## üé™ Claude Assistant Integration

### CC-Sessions Workflow
*Primary task management now uses cc-sessions format*

**Create new work:**
- "Create a task for: [description]"
- Tasks auto-created in `sessions/tasks/` with proper structure

**Start work:**
- "Let's work on [task-name]" or "Work on h-augmentgrowth-vision-doc"
- Claude loads task context and discusses approach

**Implementation:**
- Say "go ahead" / "run that" / "make it so" / "ship it" to trigger implementation
- Claude enforces discussion-before-implementation workflow

**Task switching:**
- Reference tasks by filename (e.g. "h-reddit-pain-point-research-20250916")
- Context automatically preserved across sessions

### Legacy Task Integration
*For tasks still in traditional format*

**Daily Planning Prompt:**
"Based on my current tasks, energy level, and schedule constraints, help me prioritize today's focus items and suggest optimal time blocks for completion."

**Weekly Review Prompt:**
"Review my completed tasks and help me plan next week's priorities, considering upcoming deadlines and long-term goals."
