**Energy Level (1-10):** Target 9-10 for morning block
**Available Time:** 3 hours focused deep work (9am-12pm)
**Key Priorities:** Move from research to actionable service offerings
**Potential Obstacles:** Reddit rabbit holes, perfectionism on agent concepts

## üéØ Success Criteria for Tomorrow

**By 12pm, you should have:**
1. **Concrete pain points** with real examples from validated communities
2. **Specific agent concepts** that directly address identified problems
3. **Market-ready service definitions** ready for customer validation

**Business Impact:** This moves AugmentGrowth from research phase to service validation phase - critical milestone for 3-month $25K MRR goal.

## üö® Anti-Perfectionism Reminders

- **Reddit mining**: Focus on quantity and variety, not exhaustive research
- **Agent concepts**: Aim for "good enough to test" not "perfect solutions"
- **Service definition**: Create testable hypotheses, not final offerings

**Daily accountability question**: *What's the one thing you can ship today that proves your concept works, and what's stopping you from shipping it right now?*
