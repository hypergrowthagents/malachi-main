I'll help you create or enhance a table with Advanced Tables plugin integration. This command creates tables with embedded TBLFM formulas that work seamlessly with your installed Advanced Tables plugin.

## What I can create for you:

**📊 Project Tracking Tables** - Budget, spent, remaining, progress calculations
**⏱️ Time Tracking Tables** - Estimated vs actual hours with variance analysis
**💰 Financial Tracking Tables** - Budget vs actual with percentage calculations
**📋 Task Management Tables** - Priority, status, completion tracking
**📈 KPI Dashboard Tables** - Metrics tracking with automated calculations
**🎯 Goal Tracking Tables** - Target vs actual progress monitoring
**📝 Content Planning Tables** - Publishing schedules with status tracking
**👥 Team Workload Tables** - Capacity planning and allocation

## Tell me:

1. **What type of table** do you need? (or describe your specific use case)
2. **What data/columns** should it include?
3. **What calculations** do you want automated? (sums, averages, percentages, etc.)
4. **Where should it be created?** (current file, specific project folder, etc.)

## Examples:

- "Create a project budget table for AugmentGrowth with spend tracking"
- "Make a time tracking table for this week's tasks with variance calculations"
- "Build a content calendar table with publishing status and metrics"
- "Design a team capacity table with workload percentages"

I'll create a table with:
✅ **Advanced Tables plugin compatibility**
✅ **TBLFM formulas** for automatic calculations
✅ **Sample data** to demonstrate functionality
✅ **Proper formatting** for numbers, percentages, etc.
✅ **Clear instructions** for formula evaluation

**Next step after creation**: Click "Evaluate Formulas" button in Obsidian toolbar to activate calculations!

What type of table would you like me to create?
