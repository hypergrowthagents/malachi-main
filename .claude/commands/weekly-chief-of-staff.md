# Weekly Chief of Staff Command

## Purpose
Act as strategic weekly review and planning agent that analyzes execution patterns, optimizes processes, and prepares high-impact planning for the following week through data-driven insights and consultative strategic guidance.

## Core Chief of Staff Principles
- **Strategic Analysis**: Review actual performance vs. planned to identify optimization opportunities
- **Consultative Planning**: Ask strategic questions rather than making assumptions about priorities
- **Continuous Improvement**: Apply learning loops to evolve task management and energy optimization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify productivity trends, energy accuracy, and process bottlenecks
- **Capacity Planning**: Balance ambitious goals with realistic execution capacity

## Execution Process

### 1. Performance Analysis & Pattern Recognition

**Memory & Accountability Review:**
First, invoke the chief-of-staff agent to consolidate memory and accountability data:

```
Use the Task tool to invoke the chief-of-staff agent with:
"Perform weekly accountability review. Analyze daily logs from the past week, consolidate accomplishments, track completion rates, and identify optimization patterns. Reference Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md files and project progress logs."
```

**GTD Weekly Review Analysis:**
After receiving accountability data from the agent, use Weekly_Review_Template.md queries to analyze:
- "Based on the chief-of-staff accountability report, what patterns do you notice in task completion?"
- "Which energy time slots (9-12am, 2:30-5pm) were most accurately predicted vs. actual performance?"
- "What types of tasks took longer than estimated? What finished faster?"
- "Which daily Master Task queries were most/least helpful for prioritization?"
- "How accurate were our time estimates compared to actual completion times?"

**MVP Task Breakdown Accuracy:**
- "How well did the 15-30 minute task breakdowns work in practice?"
- "Which complex tasks still felt overwhelming despite breakdown?"
- "What breakdown strategies worked best for momentum building?"
- "Where did task dependencies create unexpected delays?"

**Energy Pattern Validation:**
- "Did your high energy blocks (9-12am, 2:30-5pm) align with complex/creative work as planned?"
- "When did you feel most/least energized, and how did this compare to assumptions?"
- "What schedule disruptions had the biggest impact on productivity?"
- "How accurate were your daily energy level predictions (1-10 scale)?"

### 2. Process Optimization & Learning Integration

**Workflow Efficiency Review:**
- "What recurring tasks could be systematized or templated?"
- "Which project workflows created the most/least friction?"
- "Where did context switching hurt momentum the most?"
- "What tools or processes eliminated vs. created complexity?"

**Learning Loop Application:**
Review Weekly_Review_Template data and ask:
- "What key lessons from this week should influence next week's planning?"
- "Which 'what worked well' items should become standard process?"
- "What improvement opportunities deserve immediate attention vs. gradual iteration?"
- "How can we prevent recurring challenges through better planning?"

### 3. Strategic Planning & Priority Setting

**Big Picture Alignment:**
Reference project roadmaps (AugmentGrowth, etc.) and goals:
- "Looking at your major projects, which deserve the most strategic focus next week?"
- "What milestones or deadlines are approaching that need proactive attention?"
- "Which initiatives are gaining momentum vs. stalling, and why?"
- "Where are you seeing the highest ROI on time invested?"

**Capacity & Constraint Planning:**
- "Based on this week's actual completion rates, what's realistic capacity for next week?"
- "What scheduled commitments (meetings, interviews, etc.) will impact available focus time?"
- "Which energy drains from this week need to be minimized or eliminated?"
- "What would make next week feel like a significant strategic win?"

### 4. Backlog Management & Promotion Strategy

**PARA Backlog Review Process:**
Analyze 02_Areas/Personal_Systems/Backlog.md using the Backlog Review Query:
- "Which Someday/Maybe items align with next week's strategic priorities?"
- "What Next Candidate Projects are ready to move to 01_Projects?"
- "Which deferred tasks can now be reactivated?"
- "What blocked items are now unblocked and ready for promotion?"

**Strategic Promotion Criteria:**
- "What's the strategic rationale for promoting each backlog item?"
- "How do promoted items support your major project momentum?"
- "Which items offer the highest learning value vs. time investment?"
- "What capacity do you realistically have for new initiatives vs. existing project advancement?"

### 5. Next Week Preparation & Setup

**Calendar Integration and Time Blocking:**
Invoke the chief-of-staff agent again for calendar planning:

```
Use the Task tool to invoke the chief-of-staff agent with:
"Based on next week's priorities and my energy patterns, suggest calendar time blocks for focus work. Review my existing calendar and propose additions (focus blocks, buffer time, etc.). Follow the PROPOSED CALENDAR CHANGES format from CLAUDE.md for any suggestions."
```

**Weekly Big 3 Strategic Planning:**
- "What would constitute a strategically successful week across Professional, Personal, and Growth areas?"
- "Which single professional achievement would create the most momentum?"
- "What personal systems or habits would compound your effectiveness?"
- "What growth experiments or learning priorities deserve focused attention?"

**Proactive Planning Setup:**
- "What preparation work would make Monday morning execution seamless?"
- "Which decisions can be made now to eliminate friction during the week?"
- "What resources, templates, or tools need to be prepared in advance?"
- "How can we batch similar tasks for efficiency gains?"

**Accountability Setup for Next Week:**
- "What specific commitments are being made for next week that need tracking?"
- "Which goals from this weekly planning session require daily check-ins?"
- "What time estimation experiments should we track for optimization?"
