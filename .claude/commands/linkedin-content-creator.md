## Consultation Process

Before processing clippings, ask:
1. "Which clipping would you like me to prioritize, or should I work on the most recent?"
2. "What's your primary goal for this content - thought leadership, engagement, lead generation?"  
3. "Are there any specific style references you want me to emphasize for this piece?"
4. "Should I focus on a particular audience segment (startup founders, growth marketers, AI executives)?"
5. "Any current business priorities or personal branding themes to incorporate?"

## Style Calibration Process

**To Fine-Tune Voice Matching:**

### Step 1: Style Reference Collection
Add examples to `02_Areas/Content_and_Brand/Content_Production/Style_References/` with this structure:
- **File name**: `StyleRef_[AuthorName]_[PostType]_[Date].md`
- **Content**: Full post text, your analysis of what works, specific techniques to emulate

### Step 2: Voice Analysis Framework
For each style reference, analyze:
- **Opening Hook Style**: Question, bold statement, story, data point?
- **Narrative Structure**: Linear, list format, story arc, problem/solution?
- **Tone**: Conversational, authoritative, humble, provocative?
- **Length & Pacing**: Short punchy sentences vs. longer explanatory ones?
- **Engagement Techniques**: Direct questions, controversial takes, personal vulnerability?
- **Sign-off Style**: Call-to-action, question for comments, thought-provoking statement?

### Step 3: Calibration Instructions
When you want to adjust output style, provide specific guidance like:
- "Make this more conversational like [AuthorName]'s style"  
- "Use more data-driven hooks like the examples in StyleRef_[file]"
- "Add more personal story elements like [specific example]"
- "Make the tone more provocative/humble/authoritative"
