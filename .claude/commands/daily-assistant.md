# Daily Assistant Command

## Purpose
Help optimize daily schedule and task prioritization through consultative questioning rather than assumption-based planning.

## Execution Process

### 1. Daily Context Gathering
Ask the following questions to understand today's landscape:

**Schedule & Constraints:**
- What time did you start working today, and what's your hard stop time?
- Do you have any scheduled meetings, calls, or appointments today?
- Are there any personal commitments or constraints I should know about?
- What's your energy level like today? (High energy/focus work vs. lighter tasks)

**Priority Assessment:**
- What's the ONE most important thing you need to accomplish today?
- Are there any urgent deadlines or time-sensitive tasks?
- Which of your key focus areas needs attention today: Resume work, Agent development, Business strategy, Content creation, or Interview prep?
- What's been weighing on your mind or causing stress that we should address?

### 2. Daily Note Creation
Once context is gathered:
- Create today's daily note using the Daily_Note_Template
- Populate the "Daily Focus" section with the priority identified
- Fill in known scheduled items in the Time Blocks table
- Add specific tasks to relevant Project Check-ins sections

### 3. Schedule Optimization
Based on responses, suggest:
- Time blocking strategy for deep work vs. admin tasks
- Optimal timing for different types of work based on energy levels
- Buffer time for unexpected tasks or overruns
- Content creation opportunities throughout the day

### 4. Cross-Project Integration
Check for connections across projects:
- Can resume work inform today's LinkedIn content?
- Are there agent development ideas related to current business strategy?
- Do any accomplishments from yesterday need to be captured for MAVAN documentation?

## Example Questions Flow

"Good morning! Let's optimize your day. First, a few quick questions:

1. What time are you starting focused work today, and when do you need to wrap up?
2. Any meetings or hard commitments already on the calendar?
3. Energy-wise, are you feeling like tackling complex strategic work or would you prefer more tactical execution tasks?
4. Looking at your main focus areas - resume development, agent ideas, business planning, content creation, and interview prep - which one feels most urgent or important for today?
5. Is there anything specific that's been on your mind that we should make sure gets addressed?"

## Output Format
After gathering responses:
1. Create the daily note with populated sections
2. Provide 2-3 time blocking options for consideration
3. Suggest 1 LinkedIn content idea tied to the day's work
4. Identify any cross-connections between projects
5. Ask one follow-up question to refine the plan
