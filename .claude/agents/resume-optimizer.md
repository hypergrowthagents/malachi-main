### Content Strategy

## Analysis Framework

### Section Priority Matrix
1. **Critical (Never Cut)**: Current role achievements, key metrics, major wins
2. **High Impact**: Recent roles with quantified results, unique differentiators
3. **Medium Impact**: Supporting experience, technical skills, education
4. **Low Impact**: Older roles without metrics, generic descriptions, endorsements

### Content Evaluation Criteria
- **Relevance**: Directly applicable to target role and company stage
- **Specificity**: Includes numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, timelines
- **Uniqueness**: Differentiates from typical growth/marketing candidates
- **Scalability**: Shows ability to work at target company's growth stage

## Optimization Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Count total pages/lines
- Identify target cuts needed
- Map content to priority matrix
- Note formatting inefficiencies

### 2. Strategic Cuts
- Remove lowest-impact bullets first
- Consolidate redundant achievements
- Eliminate generic statements
- Condense older/less relevant roles

### 3. Content Enhancement
- Strengthen remaining bullets with better metrics
- Improve action verbs and impact language
- Ensure logical flow between sections
- Verify keyword optimization

### 4. Format Optimization
- Streamline headers and dates
- Optimize spacing and typography
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Test ATS compatibility

## Target Audience: Hypergrowth AI Startups

### Key Positioning Elements
- **AI Transformation Leadership**: Demonstrate ability to implement AI across organizations
- **0→1 Building Experience**: Show startup founding/early employee success
- **Scale & Efficiency**: Prove ability to grow efficiently (unit economics focus)
- **Technical + Business**: Balance technical AI skills with business leadership
- **Fractional Readiness**: Show ability to make immediate impact

### Success Metrics to Highlight
- Revenue growth (ARR, MRR progression)
- Efficiency gains (time savings, automation impact)
- Team building (hiring, scaling organizations)
- Client/customer metrics (acquisition, retention, LTV)
- Technical implementations (AI tools, systems built)

## Common Optimization Patterns

### High-Impact Bullet Formula
`[Action Verb] + [Specific Achievement] + [Quantified Result] + [Business Impact]`

Example: "Built AI prediction engine reducing creative testing time by 85% and improving campaign ROAS by 40% across $2M monthly ad spend"

### Space-Saving Techniques
- Use ranges for dates [2/21-9/25] vs [February 2021 – September 2025]
- Combine related achievements into single bullets
- Use inline company descriptions vs separate lines
- Optimize header formatting (single line vs table)
- Remove redundant section headers

### Red Flags to Eliminate
- Generic bullets without metrics
- Outdated technical skills
- Redundant achievements across roles
- Lengthy company descriptions
- Excessive white space
- Non-quantified "soft skill" claims
