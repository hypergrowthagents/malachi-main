└── Templates/                 # Note templates (enhanced)
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Daily Planning Integration
- **Daily notes** continue using `Daily/2025/` structure
- **Time blocking** references cc-sessions tasks by name
- **Energy allocation** maps to task priority levels (h-/m-/l-/?)
- **Master_Tasks.md** becomes overview dashboard pointing to cc-sessions

#### 2. Project Integration
- **Project work** organized as cc-sessions tasks
- **Task context files** reference PARA project locations
- **Deliverables** saved to appropriate `01_Projects/` directories
- **Project status** tracked through task completion

#### 3. Area Maintenance
- **02_Areas/** continue existing structure
- **Legacy todo files** preserved for reference
- **New work** flows through cc-sessions task creation
- **Area reviews** incorporate cc-sessions task status

## 🔄 Workflow Changes

### Old Workflow (Legacy)
```
1. Add tasks to Area todo files
2. Reference in Master_Tasks.md
3. Manual priority management
4. Context rebuilt each session
5. No enforcement of methodology
```

### New Workflow (CC-Sessions)
```
1. "Create a task for: [description]"
2. Claude creates structured task file
3. Automatic context gathering
4. Discussion before implementation
5. Context preserved across sessions
6. Branch enforcement (when applicable)
```

### Transition Commands
**Creating work:**
- ❌ Old: "Add to Professional_Todos.md"
- ✅ New: "Create a task for: [specific work]"

**Starting work:**
- ❌ Old: "Help me work on vision doc"
- ✅ New: "Let's work on h-augmentgrowth-vision-doc"

**Implementation:**
- ❌ Old: Immediate changes without discussion
- ✅ New: Discussion → "go ahead" → implementation

## 📋 File Management Strategy

### Active Files (CC-Sessions Managed)
- `sessions/tasks/*.md` - All active task management
- `.claude/state/current_task.json` - Session continuity
- `sessions/sessions-config.json` - Behavior configuration

### Legacy Files (Preserved for Reference)
- `Daily/Master_Tasks.md` - Overview dashboard with cc-sessions integration
- `02_Areas/*/Professional_Todos.md` - Historical record, new work flows to cc-sessions
- `02_Areas/*/Personal_Todos.md` - Personal items continue traditional format
- `02_Areas/*/AI_Agent_Ideas.md` - Marked as legacy, new ideas become cc-sessions tasks

### Hybrid Approach Rationale
- **Structured work** (projects, development, business) → cc-sessions tasks
- **Personal maintenance** (health, admin, social) → traditional todos
- **Quick capture** → Daily notes, then promote to tasks if needed
- **Brainstorming** → Area files, then convert promising ideas to tasks

## 🎯 Operational Guidelines

### When to Create CC-Sessions Tasks
- **Any work requiring >30 minutes**
- **Multi-session projects**
- **Work requiring context preservation**
- **Professional/business development**
- **AI agent development**
- **Content creation projects**

### When to Use Traditional Todos
- **Personal maintenance items**
- **Quick administrative tasks**
- **Shopping lists and errands**
- **Social and family items**
- **Health and wellness tracking**

### Task Naming Conventions
- **h-**: Critical work, due today/tomorrow, blocking other work
- **m-**: Important work, due this week, significant impact
- **l-**: Nice-to-have, flexible timing, low impact
- **?-**: Research/investigation, uncertain scope or value

### Context File Strategy
- Reference PARA locations in task context sections
- Use relative paths from vault root
- Link to specific research files and drafts
- Maintain connection between cc-sessions and PARA structure

---

## 🔧 Maintenance & Evolution

### Weekly Review Process
1. **Review completed cc-sessions tasks** → Archive to `sessions/tasks/done/`
2. **Update PARA project status** based on task completion
3. **Convert promising ideas** from Area files to cc-sessions tasks
4. **Clean up legacy todo lists** (mark completed items)
5. **Adjust cc-sessions configuration** based on workflow learnings

### Conflict Resolution
- **Single source of truth**: Active work lives in cc-sessions
- **Legacy preservation**: Keep historical todos for reference
- **Clear boundaries**: Professional work → cc-sessions, personal → traditional
- **Migration path**: Convert any traditional todo requiring >1 session to cc-sessions task

### Success Metrics
- **Context preservation**: No rebuilding project context each session
- **Implementation discipline**: Discussion before coding maintained
- **Task completion**: Clear completion criteria and tracking
- **Workflow consistency**: Reduced cognitive load on task management

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Start using h-reddit-pain-point-research-20250916 for today's work
2. Test cc-sessions workflow with "go ahead" implementation triggers
3. Validate context preservation across work sessions

### This Week
1. Complete high-priority AugmentGrowth tasks using cc-sessions
2. Convert any additional active professional todos to cc-sessions tasks
3. Update personal workflow to distinguish cc-sessions vs traditional todos

### Ongoing
1. Weekly maintenance of task archives and project status
2. Continuous improvement of cc-sessions configuration
3. Document workflow optimizations and pattern discoveries
4. Train muscle memory on new task creation and management commands
