# Chief AI Officer
June - Sept 2025

## Core Responsibilities:
- Develop MAVAN’s AI strategy and implementation roadmap across the company
- Test and rollout new AI capabilities/tools
- Own AI enablement and adoption
	- Own resource efficiency metrics (hours saved per week/workflow)
	- Mentor employees and drive AI adoption across teams
- Build agents and workflows to automate internal processes
- Develop high leverage AI external solutions that drive future client revenue

## Accomplishments:
### - Ad Prediction Engine
- Workflow that develops, refines, and tests ad creatives using synthetic data
- Consists of 3 major pillars:
	- Customer focus group: provides feedback in the voice of the customer (driven by ICP Research)
	- Copywriter: takes customer feedback and leverages knowledge of world class copywriting principles, ad platform best practices, and brand style guides to develop targeted, on-brand concepts and copy
	- Creative analyst: evaluates creatives in a simulated environment across a scoring rubric to predict A/B test results
- Built internal Claude projects per client (highly dynamic and flexible output) and a lightweight app (workflow on rails) for accessibility 
- Allows performance team to test creatives without spending a dime; filtering out losing concepts before creative briefs even hit the production process (saving thousands of wasted spend on production and testing)
- Helps write extremely dialed in creative briefs and copy that resonate with customer profiles; can help with any marketing copywriting task
- Enabled the performance marketing team to take on creative direction and copywriting tasks without needing to hire/use specialists for support
### - Analytics Agents: Automated Performance Reporting and Insights
- Developed daily/weekly ads diagnostic reports for Meta and Google, delivered to slack
- Dramatically improves the speed and quality of insights for the team
- Workflow: pulls data from Meta/Google Ads > analyzes using Claude models > produces reports based on output templates > posts to Slack or email in nicely formatted tables. Built using Claude Code and n8n
- Includes:
	- KPI snapshot
	- Daily and Weekly metric changes 
	- Top campaigns by spend
	- Creative spotlight (alerts for fatigue, sharp KPI movements)
	- Event tracking health
	- Why metrics changed: correlation across dimensions
	- Priority issues to address
- Catches issues faster than human review; improves understanding of performance across broader team
### - Personalized AI Operating System for MAVAN
- Rolled out “master prompt” for all employees, which integrates deep knowledge about the employee, company, clients, goals, culture, projects, SOPs, and ways that AI can assist the person
- Implemented shared “projects” in Claude that were fine tuned to specific projects, workflows, knowledge areas
	- Ex: AI Project Manager - connected with MCPs, trained to pull in project-specific files/folders from gDrive, meeting notes, and agenda docs. Helps facilitate putting together weekly client updates and keeping projects on track
- Result: every new AI chat is highly optimized and relevant without requiring advanced prompting or context, which dramatically improves the speed and quality of AI outputs across the team
- Evidence: majority of the team switched over to using Claude as the daily driver for 80% of their use cases
- Implemented new SoPs for how we save information in our shared drives to maximize LLM retrieval capabilities
### - Mixture of Experts (GPTs)
- Built custom GPTs and “shared projects” that any employee could use to immediately get a fine tuned expert AI assistant in a discipline
- Helped offload the need to pull in fractional specialists from talent network, which are costly and slow to use with high coordination overhead
- These GPTs/projects came with deep research on expert profiles of world class operators in the discipline, including their principles, frameworks/mental models, processes, case studies, and more. This provides a rich profile for the AI to leverage these methods to answer problems through the voice of the expert
- Ex: B2C Paid Acquisition Expert, Web Attribution Expert, Incrementality Expert
- Team used these expert profiles to put together analysis and client outputs, improving the quality of insights and speed of generation
