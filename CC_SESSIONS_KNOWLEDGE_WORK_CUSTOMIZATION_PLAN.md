# CC-Sessions Knowledge Work Customization Plan

**Status**: In Progress - Feature Branch Implementation
**Branch**: feature/cc-sessions-knowledge-work-customization
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Risk Level**: Low (minimal changes, backwards compatible)
**Test Strategy**: Incremental rollout with validation at each step

---

## üéØ **Objective**
Make minimal, safe modifications to cc-sessions to reduce friction for knowledge work while preserving all core functionality. No major rewrites, no risky changes.

---

## üìã **Implementation Steps**

### Phase 1: Configuration-Only Changes (SAFEST)
**Goal**: Add knowledge work paths to config without touching hooks
**Risk**: None - only adds new config options
**Rollback**: Remove config entries

**Step 1.1**: Add fluid work paths to `sessions-config.json`
```json
{
  "developer_name": "malachi",
  "api_mode": false,
  "trigger_phrases": ["go ahead", "run that", "make it so", "ship it"],
  "blocked_tools": ["Edit", "Write", "MultiEdit", "NotebookEdit"],
  "fluid_work_paths": [
    "Daily/", "Templates/", "02_Areas/", "03_Resources/",
    "/notes", "/research", "/brainstorm", "/meeting"
  ],
  "strict_enforcement_paths": [
    "01_Projects/", "/vision-doc", "/financial-plan", "/pitch-deck"
  ],
  "task_detection": {"enabled": true},
  "branch_enforcement": {"enabled": true}
}
```
**Test**: Verify cc-sessions still loads and basic task creation works

### Phase 2: Hook Modification (CONSERVATIVE)
**Goal**: Add one simple check to sessions-enforce.py before existing tool blocking
**Risk**: Low - adds early exit condition, doesn't modify existing logic
**Rollback**: Comment out added lines

**Step 2.1**: Modify `sessions-enforce.py` at line 135 (before existing tool blocking)
```python
# Add after line 134, before existing tool blocking logic:

# Check for fluid work paths (knowledge work exception)
if discussion_mode and tool_name in config.get("blocked_tools", DEFAULT_CONFIG["blocked_tools"]):
    file_path = tool_input.get("file_path", "")
    if file_path:
        fluid_paths = config.get("fluid_work_paths", [])
        if any(path in file_path for path in fluid_paths):
            # Allow fluid knowledge work without discussion
            sys.exit(0)

    # Continue with existing blocking logic (unchanged)
    print(f"[DAIC: Tool Blocked] You're in discussion mode. The {tool_name} tool is not allowed. You need to seek alignment first.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)
```
**Test**: Try writing to Daily/ vs 01_Projects/ - Daily should work immediately, Projects should require "go ahead"

### Phase 3: Context Agent Adjustment (MINIMAL)
**Goal**: Add document context awareness to existing context-gathering agent
**Risk**: Very low - only adds to existing prompt, doesn't remove anything
**Rollback**: Revert agent file

**Step 3.1**: Add knowledge work section to `context-gathering.md` after line 30
```markdown
### Knowledge Work Context (For Document/Business Tasks)
If this is document creation, research, or business strategy work, also gather:
- Related research files and previous drafts
- Business objectives and project constraints
- Stakeholder requirements and decision criteria
- Referenced documents and source materials
- Project dependencies and timeline considerations
- Content structure and formatting requirements
```
**Test**: Create a new task and verify context-gathering agent includes document context

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Goal**: Ensure all functionality preserved while adding flexibility
**Risk**: None - pure validation

**Test Cases**:
1. **Fluid Work**: Create/edit files in Daily/, Templates/, 02_Areas/ - should work immediately
2. **Structured Work**: Create/edit files in 01_Projects/ - should require "go ahead"
3. **Task Management**: Create task, switch tasks, context preservation - should work unchanged
4. **Existing Features**: DAIC mode, trigger phrases, branch enforcement - should work unchanged

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Measures**

### Rollback Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Remove added config entries
- **Phase 2**: Comment out lines 135-143 in sessions-enforce.py
- **Phase 3**: Revert context-gathering.md to original

### Testing Protocol
1. After each phase, test basic cc-sessions functionality
2. Verify existing tasks still work
3. Test new behavior meets requirements
4. If any issues, immediately rollback that phase

### Minimal Change Principle
- **No deletion** of existing functionality
- **No modification** of existing logic flows
- **Only addition** of new conditional paths
- **Preserve** all existing configurations and behaviors

---

## üìà **Expected Outcomes**

### Before Changes
- ALL writing requires "go ahead" trigger
- Research notes blocked until discussion
- Iterative document work requires constant approval

### After Changes
- **Fluid paths** (Daily/, research) allow immediate writing
- **Deliverable paths** (Projects/) still require discussion
- **All existing functionality** preserved unchanged
- **Task management** benefits remain intact

---

## üîß **Implementation Order**

1. **Start with Phase 1** (config only) - test basic functionality
2. **Add Phase 2** (hook modification) - test path-based blocking
3. **Add Phase 3** (context enhancement) - test document context gathering
4. **Phase 4** (comprehensive testing) - validate full workflow

**Duration**: 1-2 hours total, with testing at each step
**Complexity**: Low - straightforward additions to existing system

---

## üö® **Rollback Plan**

If anything breaks:
1. **Immediate**: `git checkout main` to return to working state
2. **Investigate**: Check specific phase that caused issues
3. **Fix Forward**: Make minimal correction OR rollback specific change
4. **Document**: Update this plan with lessons learned

Branch will not be merged to main until full testing confirms stability.
