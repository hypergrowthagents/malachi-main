At 27, I left my 6-figure role at Miro without a plan B.

Here’s what happened next →

- I made an announcement on LinkedIn 
- Gained eyeballs from companies like Intercom and Grammarly
- Said no to full-time. Used the moment for soft pitches
- Manychat became my first advisory client
- The rest became long-term relationships
- Launched a podcast and invited them to share knowledge
- Built credibility + experience through it
- Invested time in a high-value lead magnet (Growthmates Playbook)
- Launched it free → ~2,000 subscribers joined
- Turned them into warm leads → which led to clients

If you’re in the same place, here’s a 60-day roadmap 👇

Weeks 1-2: Clarity

- Choose 1–2 themes you’d happily study for years.
- Not “what’s trending.” What you can’t stop researching.

This becomes your voice.

Weeks 3-4: Announce yourself

- Post your “I’ve left / I’m building” announcement.
- Don’t make it vague. Defining your clear positioning is key.
- Eg: I positioned myself as an expert in PLG ✕ UX intersection.

Weeks 5-6: Run a referral sprint

- Reach out to 10 people you know and trust.
- Ask for introductions to 1–2 people who’d benefit from your skills.
- Warm intros have a high chance of conversion.

That’s how you land your first clients without aggressive cold DMs.
This moment is a magnet for opportunities.

Weeks 7-8: Build your first asset

- Create a lead magnet (playbook/teardown).
- Make it Free - this is about awareness building.
- What matters is proving people want your way of thinking.

Main takeaway?

- Announcements done right = free and relevant inbound.
- Invest time in high-value assets for your audience.
- Relationships scale further than transactions.

Sometimes, no plan B is all you need to figure it out
