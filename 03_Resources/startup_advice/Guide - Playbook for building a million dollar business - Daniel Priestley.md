This playbook is a comprehensive outline derived from the "I’ve Mentored 1,000 Millionaires" video, detailing the five steps required to move from a vague idea to monetizing your intellectual property (IP) and scaling up the business [1, 2].

## Playbook for Building a Million-Dollar Business

The process has taken thousands of people from having a directional, vague idea to very specifically monetizing their intellectual property (IP) [1].

### Step 1: Create a Product Underpinned by Proof

**Context:** The starting point is identifying the unique intellectual property (IP) you already possess based on your personal experiences and successes over the last five years [1, 3, 4].

| Concept | Definition & Implementation | Source Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proof Story** | A magical moment from the last five years containing intellectual property [4]. It must include: (1) something special relevant to an **Ideal Customer Persona (ICP)**; (2) a **quantifiable outcome** (given a name); and (3) a step-by-step explanation of how the outcome was achieved [4]. | [4] |
| **Intellectual Property (IP)** | The unique material stemming from your story, emotions, steps, and personal take on things [3]. The name you give to the quantifiable outcome can be registered and associated with your business [5]. | [3, 5] |
| **Product for Prospects (PFP)** | The first product, designed for people to **learn** about your proof story and IP (e.g., the steps and the quantifiable outcome) [5]. | [5] |
| **PFP Delivery Mechanisms** | Ways for prospects to learn about the IP, such as through a webinar, an online assessment, or an online mini-course [6]. | [6] |
| **PFP Productization** | Requires an **online landing page** to present the PFP [5, 6]. | [6] |
| **Core Offering** | The second product, designed for people to **get the IP delivered**—they either get it done for them or get to replicate the proof story [5]. | [5] |
| **Core Offering Delivery Mechanisms** | Methods include delivery through an agency (doing it for them), software, physical products, or consulting [6]. | [6] |
| **Core Offering Productization** | Requires a **slide deck or a brochure** (potentially digital PDF) that explains what is delivered and the price [6, 7]. | [6, 7] |

### Step 2: Get Attention

**Context:** You must be willing to be an **attention seeker** because your entire business success is downstream from attention [8]. Attention involves three phases: becoming noticed, known, and rated [8, 9].

| Phase & Concept | Definition & Implementation | Source Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Become Noticed** | People notice you when they see you for the 11th time [8, 9]. | [8, 9] |
| *Implementation (Short Form Content)* | Put out 11 pieces of short content within 90 days [10]. This includes short posts, short videos, image carousels, or posts on LinkedIn and Instagram [8, 10]. Posting **every single day** allows new people to notice you every two weeks [10]. | [8, 10] |
| **2. Become Known** | People need to spend 2 to 7 hours with you to develop a sense that they know you [9, 11]. | [9, 11] |
| *Implementation (Long Form Content)* | Create content that allows for 2 to 7 hours of consumption [11]. Examples include long posts (e.g., 1,500-word reports on LinkedIn), long videos (like the source video itself), books, guest appearances on podcasts, or attending a live workshop or keynote speech [9, 11]. | [9, 11] |
| **3. Become Rated** | Getting associated with other brands to determine your perceived price point (discount, mass market, niche market, or luxury) [12]. | [12] |
| *Implementation (Association)* | Ensure you are seen aligned with **four other brands** that give cues on how to rate you [12, 13]. For instance, a luxury rating could be established by association with a private jet, a Rolls-Royce, and high-end hotels [13]. | [12, 13] |

### Step 3: Signals of Interest

**Context:** After establishing your product and attention, you need people to signal that they are interested in learning more; this signal generates a **lead** [14, 15].

| Concept | Definition & Implementation | Source Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanism** | A **high-converting landing page** is the magical device used to collect signals of interest [14, 15]. | [14, 15] |
| **Key Element 1: Hook** | Something that hooks attention. Types include a **Frustration Hook** (naming a frustration people would feel if they lacked your IP) or a **Readiness Hook** (asking if they are ready to achieve a desired new outcome) [16, 17]. | [16, 17] |
| **Key Element 2: Value Proposition** | Explains the value of your IP—how you will alleviate frustration or get them the desired outcome better, faster, cheaper, or with more emotional benefits [17]. | [17] |
| **Key Element 3: Credibility** | Evidence to overcome doubts and build trust, such as your story, background, research, statistics, relevant facts, or a headshot and bio [15]. | [15] |
| **Key Element 4: Call to Action (CTA)** | Tells people precisely what action to take next to engage with the **Product for Prospects** [15, 18]. Examples: "Start the assessment," "Register for the workshop," or "Join the waiting list" [15, 18]. | [15, 18] |
| **Recommended Tool** | **Score App** is the recommended technology for collecting signaled interest via landing pages and managing leads [18, 19]. | [18, 19] |

### Step 4: Sales Conversions

**Context:** The objective is to convert leads (signaled interest from the PFP stage) into sales of the Core Offering [20, 21].

| Concept | Definition & Implementation | Source Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LAPS Dashboard** | A necessary system for measurement and tracking. LAPS stands for **Leads, Appointments, Presentations, and Sales** [20]. | [20] |
| **Sales Process** | Moving prospects through the following stages: (1) collecting the lead; (2) booking a one-to-one or group sales appointment; (3) presenting the Core Offering to educate them on the IP/methods; and (4) making the sale [20, 21]. | [20, 21] |
| **Conversion Measurement** | Tracking conversions between each stage (e.g., 100 leads to 15 appointments, 10 presentations, 3 sales) [21]. | [21] |
| **Entrepreneur's Role** | The entrepreneur's core job is to constantly brainstorm ways to improve conversion rates at every step of the LAPS dashboard week after week [19, 21]. This activity is typically performed within a **perfect repeatable week** rhythm [19]. | [19, 21] |
| **Tools** | A **Google sheet** or the mini CRM system on the back end of **Score App** can be used to manage leads and track data [2, 19]. | [2, 19] |

### Step 5: Scale Up

**Context:** The final step involves leveraging all created assets (IP, attention, conversion process) at a greater scale, primarily by using paid promotions [22].

| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Scaling Foundation**             | Requires calculating your allowable costs based on the LAPS dashboard data [22].                                                                                                                                                                    | [22]            |
| **Allowable Cost Per Sale (ACPS)** | The maximum amount you are willing to spend to generate one sale (e.g., 15% of the Core Offering price) [22].                                                                                                                                       | [22]            |
| **Allowable Cost Per Lead (ACPL)** | The maximum you can spend to acquire a single lead while staying within your ACPS, calculated using your lead-to-sale conversion rate [23].                                                                                                         | [23]            |
| **Mechanism**                      | **Paid Promotions** are used to scale up lead generation once ACPS and ACPL are known [23].                                                                                                                                                         | [23]            |
| **Paid Promotion Types**           | **Ads** (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, X); **Joint Venture Partnerships** (paying influencers or organizations); **Paid Outreach** (paying someone to call prospects or send DMs); and **Sponsorships** (events, newsletters, YouTube channels) [24]. | [23, 24]        |
| **Scaling Strategy**               | Slowly ratchet up spending on paid promotions (e.g., $10,000 one month, $12,000 the next), constantly tracking that the spend remains within the calculated ACPS and ACPL limits [25].                                                              | [24, 25]        |
