# Fractional [ROLE] Proposal Template
## Strategic Partnership Proposal for [CLIENT_NAME]

> **Template Guide:** This template is based on the DMS proposal structure that successfully balances comprehensiveness with conciseness. Optimized for Document format in Gamma. See References section at bottom for best practices.

---

## Executive Summary

**Template Structure: 4 paragraphs, ~150-200 words total**

[CLIENT_NAME] faces a critical [FUNCTIONAL_AREA] leadership gap. [1-2 SENTENCE SUMMARY OF THEIR CURRENT STATE AND PAIN POINTS].

**The opportunity is substantial:** [TRANSFORMATION STATEMENT - What you'll help them achieve in terms of operations, team, and outcomes]. With [THEIR_RESOURCES - e.g., PE backing, strong team, existing budget], you have the resources—you need the [TYPE OF LEADERSHIP] to channel them effectively.

**I propose a [DURATION]-month fractional [ROLE] engagement** to [PRIMARY_DELIVERABLES - infrastructure, processes, capabilities]. Using the same methodology that delivered [KEY_PROOF_POINT - e.g., 60-70% CAC reduction for KidStrong], this engagement focuses on [SHORT_TERM_WIN - e.g., establishing strong foundations in 90 days] and demonstrating [LONG_TERM_WIN - e.g., measurable transformation by 6 months].

**Recommended approach:** [PRIMARY_DAYS] days/week at $[PRIMARY_PRICE]/month, with flexibility to scale to [SECONDARY_DAYS] days/week at $[SECONDARY_PRICE]/month if needed.

**Guidance:**
- Lead with their pain, not your solution
- Reference your most relevant case study proof point
- Keep pricing upfront and transparent
- Make the time-to-value clear (e.g., 90 days for foundations, 6 months for transformation)

## Understanding Your Challenge

**Template Structure: 3-4 major challenge categories with 2-4 bullets each**

Based on our conversation, you're facing interconnected challenges that require immediate leadership:

### [CHALLENGE_CATEGORY_1 - e.g., Leadership Vacuum]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_1]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_2]
- [IMPACT_OR_CONSEQUENCE]

### [CHALLENGE_CATEGORY_2 - e.g., Zero Measurement Framework]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_1]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_2]
- [IMPACT_OR_CONSEQUENCE]

### [CHALLENGE_CATEGORY_3 - e.g., Fundamental Execution Gaps]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_1]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_2]
- [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_3]
- [QUANTIFIABLE_GAP - e.g., Operating at <10% vs industry leaders' 50-80%]

### [CHALLENGE_CATEGORY_4 - e.g., Strategic Opportunity Unrealized]
- [POSITIVE_ASSET_1 - e.g., Strong team and resources]
- [POSITIVE_ASSET_2 - e.g., Vision exists but needs execution]
- [UNTAPPED_POTENTIAL]

**The core issue:** [ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY - typically "You have [RESOURCES] but lack [MISSING_PIECE] to channel them into [DESIRED_OUTCOME]"]

**Guidance:**
- Mirror their language from discovery calls
- Balance negative (problems) with positive (unrealized potential)
- Show you deeply understand their situation
- This section = empathy and credibility building

---

## The Opportunity: What's Possible

**Template Structure: What you'll achieve across 3 dimensions**

**With proper [TYPE_OF_LEADERSHIP], your team can achieve:**

**[DIMENSION_1 - e.g., Operational Excellence]:**
- [INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPABILITY_1]
- [INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPABILITY_2]
- [INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPABILITY_3]
- [INFRASTRUCTURE_CAPABILITY_4]
- [DIFFERENTIATOR - e.g., AI-powered workflows that multiply effectiveness]

**[DIMENSION_2 - e.g., Team Transformation]:**
- [TEAM_OUTCOME_1]
- [TEAM_OUTCOME_2]
- [TEAM_OUTCOME_3]
- [LASTING_IMPACT - e.g., Knowledge transfer ensuring improvements outlast engagement]

**[DIMENSION_3 - e.g., Strategic Opportunities] (To Be Evaluated & Prioritized Together):**

We'll identify and prioritize your highest-impact opportunities, which may include:

- **[OPPORTUNITY_1]:** [Brief description with quantifiable benchmark if possible]
- **[OPPORTUNITY_2]:** [Brief description]
- **[OPPORTUNITY_3]:** [Brief description]
- **[OPPORTUNITY_4]:** [Brief description]
- **[OPPORTUNITY_5]:** [Brief description]

Specific priorities will emerge from discovery.

**Guidance:**
- First two dimensions = definite outcomes you'll deliver
- Third dimension = potential opportunities to explore together
- Use "To Be Evaluated & Prioritized Together" to manage expectations
- Include quantifiable benchmarks where possible (e.g., "from 10% to 20%")
- End with "Specific priorities will emerge from discovery" to avoid over-promising

---

## How We'll Work Together

**Template Structure: 3 phases with Activities + Deliverables/Outcomes**

---

## Timeline Expectations

**Template Structure: 3 milestone checkpoints + expectations statement**

**This is a [DURATION]-month transformation with progressive milestones:**

**[CHECKPOINT_1 - e.g., 30 Days]:** [Brief outcome summary]

**[CHECKPOINT_2 - e.g., 90 Days]:** [Brief outcome summary]

**[CHECKPOINT_3 - e.g., 6 Months]:** [Brief outcome summary]

**Realistic expectations:** [EXPECTATION_STATEMENT - e.g., "You should see operational improvements and early positive signals by 90 days, with measurable business impact becoming clear over the full 6-month engagement."]

**Guidance:**
- Keep each checkpoint to one sentence
- Use em-dashes to separate elements (Foundation & clarity—diagnosis complete, roadmap built)
- Final expectations statement manages timeline expectations
- Don't repeat details from "How We'll Work Together" section

### What We Need From You (Critical Success Factors)

For this engagement to deliver maximum impact, we'll need collaborative support from [CLIENT_NAME]:

**[CATEGORY_1 - e.g., Access & Transparency]:**
- [REQUIREMENT_1]
- [REQUIREMENT_2]

**[CATEGORY_2 - e.g., Responsiveness & Support]:**

Note: Deliverables above assume [PRIMARY_DAYS]-day/wk scope

**Guidance:**
- "What We Need From You" sets mutual accountability
- Frame as "Critical Success Factors" not demands
- Include 3-4 categories of requirements
- Always include one "Optional (High Value)" item
- Keep note about scope assumption at bottom

---

## Investment Options

**Template Structure: Primary option (recommended) + Secondary option + Logistics + Optional incentives**

### Option 1: [OPTION_1_NAME - e.g., Comprehensive Engagement] (Recommended)
**[PRIMARY_DAYS] days per week at $[PRIMARY_PRICE]/month**

Given the complexity of your challenges—[CHALLENGE_1], [CHALLENGE_2], [CHALLENGE_3]—I recommend the comprehensive [PRIMARY_DAYS]-day/week engagement to ensure sufficient bandwidth for both strategic leadership and hands-on transformation.

**What you get with [PRIMARY_DAYS] days/week:**

**[CATEGORY_1 - e.g., Strategic Leadership]:**
- [DELIVERABLE_1]
- [DELIVERABLE_2]

**[CATEGORY_2 - e.g., Hands-On Execution Support]:**
- [DELIVERABLE_1]
- [DELIVERABLE_2]
- [DELIVERABLE_3]
- [DELIVERABLE_4]

**[CATEGORY_3 - e.g., AI Implementation] (Larger Scope):**
- [DELIVERABLE_1]
- **[HIGHLIGHTED_DELIVERABLE_1]** [with emphasis]
- **[HIGHLIGHTED_DELIVERABLE_2]** [with emphasis]
- [DELIVERABLE_2]
- [DELIVERABLE_3]

### Option 2: [OPTION_2_NAME - e.g., Strategic Guidance Engagement]
**[SECONDARY_DAYS] days per week at $[SECONDARY_PRICE]/month**

[ONE_SENTENCE_POSITIONING - e.g., Strategic leadership, planning, and coaching with reduced hands-on execution support. Best suited if you have strong internal execution capacity or want to start with lighter engagement.]

**What you get with [SECONDARY_DAYS] days/week:**

Includes [WHAT_STAYS_1], [WHAT_STAYS_2], and [WHAT_STAYS_3].

**Reduced scope:**
- [REDUCTION_1 with explanation]
- [REDUCTION_2 with explanation]
- [REDUCTION_3 with explanation]
- [OVERALL_IMPACT - e.g., More reliance on internal team for execution vs. collaborative implementation]

### Logistics
- **[DURATION]-month initial term** with [OPT_OUT_PERIOD]-day opt-out clause (either side, any reason)
- **Post-[DURATION] months:** Rolls to month-to-month continuation
- **Specific days committed** each week (consistent schedule with flexibility when needed)
- **[LOCATION] engagement** with [ON_SITE_POLICY]
- **Travel and expenses** not included; discussed case-by-case if needed

### Optional Performance Incentives
I'm open to adding performance-based incentives, which I've seen be highly motivational in previous engagements. We can set aggressive improvement goals tied to bonus payouts upon achievement (e.g. +[BONUS_%]% bonus if [KPI_TARGET] is achieved). This is completely optional and at your discretion.

**Guidance:**
- Lead with recommended option (usually higher commitment)
- Don't include "Why this option" section (redundant with "What you get")
- Structure Option 2 as "Includes X, Y, Z" then "Reduced: A, B, C"
- This makes trade-offs crystal clear
- Keep logistics consistent (6-month term, 14-day opt-out, remote-first)
- Performance incentives = optional (shows flexibility, not pushiness)

---

## Flexible Evolution Options

**Template Structure: Two scenarios combined into one section**

**If you hire a full-time [ROLE]:**
- [TRANSITION_OPTION_1 - e.g., Transition to advisor/backstop role]

The [DURATION]-month structure with mutual opt-out provides maximum flexibility to find the right long-term arrangement.

**Guidance:**
- Don't separate into two sections (creates redundancy)
- "Flexible Evolution Options" = one section with two scenarios
- Shows you're thinking long-term and adaptable
- Addresses both "what if you hire someone" and "what if we want to continue"
