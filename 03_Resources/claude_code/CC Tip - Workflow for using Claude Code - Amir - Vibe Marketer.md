amp, claude code, cursor, warp

if you're feeling anxious about all these latest tools and not sure what to use

don't worry, you're not alone

I'm going to help you decide what to use and how to use it

1. claude code -> start your project scaffolding

2. plan mode - opus 4.1 to generate your prd

3. create a claude.md + task-manager.md file to track context on existing tasks

4. get claude to generate a agent.md incase you use other agentic tools like cursor or @AmpCode 

5. use claude to build your main project features

6. if you get stuck on a bug or have a complex feature, use amp code to work on the task in parallel

think of this as your agentic toolbelt, bring in each one when you need it to do a specific task and you'll go far
