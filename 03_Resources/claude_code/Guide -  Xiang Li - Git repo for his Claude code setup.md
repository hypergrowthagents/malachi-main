**Takeaways:**
- Use this as an example to write my own Claude Code setup post (find ways to differentiate my own)
- Use CC to explore his open sourced setup and see what I might want to borrow/use from it

My inbox exploded with 3,000+ DMs asking for my Claude Code setup

So I open sourced it: https://lnkd.in/eBSkgg9A

I've tried every AI assistant app out there. Even built one myself last year. They all fail for the same reason.

We all have wildly different workflows.

No product can handle everyone's edge cases. Your calendar logic isn't mine. Your email priorities aren't mine. Your sprint planning definitely isn't mine.

Claude Code solves this differently.

It handles massive codebases so well that using it for personal tasks just... works. Better than any app designed for it.

You write your own logic. Define your own workflows. The agent framework adapts to how I work, not the other way around.

While everyone's waiting for the perfect AI assistant app, you can build exactly what you need today.

The repo has everything - agent templates, MCP server configs, the works. Fork it and make it yours.

Need engineers who can orchestrate 10 agents?
• 8 for shipping code
• 1 for automating business ops
• 1 for being your chief of staff

We find them at Superposition.

(If you need help setting up the Claude Code template, shoot me a DM.

Takeaway: here’s the post that got Xiang over 500k impressions

Most people use Claude Code just for coding

I use it to run my life.

I have a whole system of agents that orchestrates everything. It spawns sub-agents to:
• Scan my email and know what needs attention
• Schedule my day based on actual priorities
• Write my stand up notes
• Help with sprint planning

My personal memory stays local. Full control. MCP servers connect to Notion (todos) and G Suite (email/calendar).

But here's what no personal assistant app can do:

I can spawn custom sub-agents on demand.

Need a new workflow? Write it. Need different logic? Define it. The agent adapts to how I work, not the other way around.

While everyone's debating which AI app to use, I built my own operating system.

Claude Code isn't just a coding tool.

It's the most flexible agentic framework out there.

If you want my setup, comment below and I'll DM it to you.
