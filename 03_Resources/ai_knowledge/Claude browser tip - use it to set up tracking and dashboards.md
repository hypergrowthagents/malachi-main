==Vibe Marketing Hack - Claude + Chrome Will Set Up GA4, GTM, GSC, etc.==

Hi All, I think many might find this very useful. If you have access to the Claude Chrome extension, you can use it to **automate setup of integrations like Google Analytics and Google Search Console**.

I asked it to **take control and review my GA setup**, and it found several things that needed to be properly set up in the admin section... and went and did it for me!

I then tried setting it up fresh on a new site, and similarly, Claude did all of the finger work.

I asked it to **set up the dashboards** I should be using every day, and spoiler alert, it did that too. It even pulled up another tab to look at my site to set up key events!

Then, I had it **review performance of content pages, recommend actions, and create a prompt for Claude Code to make the changes**, copy/paste, boom bada bing.

I love these epiphany moments, don't you?
