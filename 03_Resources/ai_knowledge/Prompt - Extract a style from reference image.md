Pro tip to help with transferring styles with nano banana: 

Don’t use the image as a reference because it interferes with your additional prompt.

What you should do is give the image with the style you want to replicate to Gemini/ChatGPt and tell it “Help me write a prompt that can be used to replicate this exact image style to other illustration assets. Do not write any specific details about this image, only capture the essence and style of the image so it can be used to make other images in this same consistent style.”

I’ve been doing this and have had way way better results than just giving it an image and telling it to copy the style in reference image and make a new image of XYZ.
