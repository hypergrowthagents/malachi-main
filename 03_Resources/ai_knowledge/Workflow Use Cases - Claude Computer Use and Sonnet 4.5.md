The video transcript details the introduction of the new Claude agent for Chrome, featuring the Sonnet 4.5 model, which allows the AI to remote control your browser. This functionality is described as a breakthrough in efficiency and effectiveness compared to previous iterations and competing agents.

Here is an extraction of the browser agentâ€™s capabilities, use cases, and recommended implementation steps:

### Recommended Steps to Implement Browser Use

The implementation relies on adapting your current workflow to take advantage of the agent's ability to access your logged-in browser and schedule tasks.

1. **Rethink Existing Prompts:** Take some of your **favorite prompts** that you have already executed with AI and retry them within the context of the new browser agent to see if they can use your browser to generate more value or save time.
2. ==**Identify Manual Browser Tasks for Automation:** Analyze your browser history to see which sites you frequent (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.). Compare these frequently used apps with your existing prompts to identify **manual tasks that the AI could perform automatically** for you.==
3. ==**Transform Prompts for Scheduling:** Once a workflow is identified, transform the prompt to **access your browser and perform the tasks on a schedule** (e.g., running every day at 9:00 a.m.).==
4. **Establish a Context Base (Advanced Workflow):** For advanced usage, set up a project inside another AI tool (like ChatGPT) or a central document (like a Google Doc) where you keep **up-to-date context about your work or life**. The browser extension can then navigate to that context source and execute tasks based on the information it retrieves.
5. **Be Specific and Refine Prompts:** Be prepared to **refine the prompt** if the agent misunderstands instructions (e.g., specifying "email content" instead of just "email" for a column).
6. **Sequence Tasks:** If performing multiple tasks simultaneously, realize that you may need to **sequence these things**, as the agent may hesitate if it is already actively working in another tab.
7. **Consider Confirmation Mode:** While the "act without asking" mode exists, it is **not recommended** due to security risks; it is advisable to let the agent ask for confirmation before acting.
### Capabilities of the Browser Use Agent

The new browser agent, offered as a **Chrome extension (Claude for Chrome)**, offers significant advantages and functionalities related to computer use:

- **Remote Control and Reliability:** It has the ability to **remote control your browser** and is noted for being efficient, effective, and reliable at completing tasks.
- **Local Operation:** Unlike competing chat agents that run in their own virtual machines and frequently require users to log back into services, this agent runs in **your very own browser where you are logged in**, holding cookies and login information for way longer.
- **Enhanced Computer Use:** The model (Sonnet 4.5) demonstrates exceptional performance in "computer use" benchmarks, jumping from roughly a 42-44% success rate to **61%** in everyday browser tasks.
- **Scheduling:** Tasks can be scheduled to run automatically, such as daily at 4:00 a.m..
- **Integration with Other AI Tools:** Within the browser, Claude can use other AI tools that you have access to. For example, it can navigate to and use a subscription to the **ChatGPT Pro model to triple-verify information**.
- **Contextual Information Retrieval:** The agent can dynamically open a specific document (like a Google Doc or Google Sheet), **read all of its content into the context**, and then use that information to execute subsequent tasks, such as composing an email.
- **Autonomy and Control:** Users can set the extension to **act without asking** ("just do it mode"), or require confirmation before acting.
- **Workflow Fluidity:** It allows for more "water-like" workflows, addressing the variability of everyday problems, as opposed to the more straightforward, deterministic flows of traditional automation tools.
- **Automation Creation:** It can be used to **automate the creation of automation workflows** (like setting up a web hook in NANE or Make). Crucially, because it operates in your logged-in browser, it is able to set up necessary connections like **OAuth automatically**.
- **Self-Correction:** It has been observed to fix its own mistakes, such as overwriting a header row in a Google Sheet by inserting a new row for headers.
- **Privacy Consideration:** During testing, the agent consistently **disagreed to share privacy information on cookies** in pop-ups and would deny requests if given blatantly false information to verify.

### Use Cases for Daily Work

The browser agent enables the automation of complex, multi-step tasks that require navigating different web services. Examples demonstrated or suggested include:

| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| **Content/Research Automation**        | Automatically open YouTube Studio, pull comments from the newest video, generate shorts ideas, and store the ideas in a Google Sheet. This can be run on autopilot for multiple channels. |         |
| **Fact Verification**                  | Using a preset shortcut prompt (`/validate`), open a paid subscription AI tool (like GPT5 Pro) to **triple-verify factual information**.                                                  |         |
| **Project Management & Communication** | Set up **automatic daily project update emails** sent to team members (e.g., a boss) by drawing the most up-to-date context from a shared Google Doc.                                     |         |
| **Record Keeping/Archiving**           | Track every project update email sent by logging the date and email content into a Google Sheet.                                                                                          |         |
| **Quality Assurance (QA)**             | Automatically test internal guides or workflows (e.g., monthly) and generate a Google Sheet outlining suggestions for updates, flagging outdated information, or noting what didn't work. |         |
| ==**High ROI Idea Generation**==       | ==Use a prompt against internal company documentation (mission, vision, values, company overview) to generate specific, high-return-on-investment ideas for using the new feature.==      |         |
| **Community Support**                  | Reply to community questions or generate and evaluate "prompts of the week" using internal systems, since the agent is logged into your browser.                                          |         |
