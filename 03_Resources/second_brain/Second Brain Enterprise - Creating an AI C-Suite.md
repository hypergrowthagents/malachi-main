That's an excellent query, drawing directly from a key takeaway of the "We Taught AI to 100+ Companies - Here's What We Learned" program.

The idea of creating an **"AI C-Suite of advisors"** (fractional CMO, CRO, and CFO) was a significant finding from the program dedicated to AI business transformation [1]. These advisors are highly sophisticated and persistent [2].

Here is more detail on how you would create and utilize an AI C-Suite, based on the course's methodology:

### 1. The Foundation: Context and Shared Language

To build an effective AI C-Suite, you must first establish a foundation of context and language:

*   **Process Documentation is the Gateway:** Effective utilization of AI requires process documentation and development [3]. Process is described as the "invisible structure of business" and has become the necessary gateway to effectively utilize AI [4, 5].
*   **Foundational Frameworks:** Teaching foundational business frameworks provides a **shared language** not only between people but, most importantly, **between the user and the AI** [6]. This shared language allows you to look at everything with more precision [6].
*   **The Master Prompt:** The AI C-Suite is built upon a **master prompt** that contains detailed, personalized context saved within a self-contained workspace or project [2, 7]. This context is accumulated through an ongoing process of assessment and input [8].
*   **The Assessment Loop:** Before creating the advisors, participants ran a loop to establish context:
    1.  **Assess** the current state of a given function of your business [9].
    2.  **Put that context** (the discovery export) into your master prompt [2, 9].
    3.  **Document** the existing process [9].
    4.  **Redesign** what the process should look like with the help of AI [9].
    *Claude* was successfully used to take these diligence assessments, tailoring them and giving examples directly for specific industries [10].

### 2. Creating the AI C-Suite Personas

The AI C-Suite introduced in the program consisted of a **fractional CMO** (Chief Marketing Officer), a **fractional CRO** (Chief Revenue Officer), and a **fractional CFO** (Chief Financial Officer) [2].

**The Mechanism:**
These advisors are created by designing a **sophisticated prompt** (or a "fractional coach") built around the specialized assessments for each component piece of the business [2]. By the time you interact with these prompts, they have **full context** about that specific piece of your business [2].

**The Power of Personification:**
A crucial element of creating the AI C-Suite is **personification** [11]. Instead of calling it an "integrated financial system," calling it "your CFO" makes it more attractive and helpful for the AI [11].

*   **Assigning a Personality/Mindset:** By assigning a role (like CFO) or even an actual name (e.g., "Romina the fractional CFO" or "Mark" the fractional CMO) [12], the AI knows the specific point of view it should adopt [11]. For instance, a CFO is expected to be **"conservative and responsible and risk averse"** and will focus on pointing out those kinds of concerns [11].
*   **Increased Utility:** Personification is helpful for the user, acting as a mental trigger. For example, every time you have a financial question, you turn to your fractional CFO project instead of waiting for a human meeting [11].

**Potential Advanced Configuration:**
The source material even speculates on advanced possibilities for these roles:

*   **Multi-Agent Consensus:** You could design sophisticated, step-by-step prompts where these advisors confer (e.g., **"You guys talk, you guys confer, and then come to me with the answer"**) and reach a consensus before presenting a solution [12, 13].
*   **LLM Specialization:** In the long term, you might choose different LLMs for different roles based on their biases and strengths. For example, using **ChatGPT to be the CFO** because it's "straight and narrow," and **Claude to be the CMO** because it's "a little more creative and right-brained" [13].

### 3. Practical Usage and Prompts (Based on the Sources)

While the sources do not provide the exact master prompts used in the program, they illustrate the approach and the necessary components needed to build effective prompts for these personas:

| Fractional Role | Focus/Assessment Area | Necessary Context/Data | Core Prompt Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fractional CFO** | Financial Performance Management [5]. | Unit economics, working capital status, financial health assessment scores [2, 14]. | To act as a **conservative, responsible, and risk-averse** advisor, pointing out potential financial risks and suggesting improvements [11]. |
| **Fractional CMO** | Market to Lead process, customer life cycle [15]. | Customer acquisition costs (CAC) per channel, Lifetime Value (LTV), Unique Value Proposition (UVP) research [1, 16]. | To coach you through an assessment of current channels, analyze the full unit economics per channel, and recommend new channels or strategic changes (e.g., "should be doing YouTube and LinkedIn") [2, 16]. |
| **Fractional CRO** | Lead to Sale and Sale to Delivery processes [15]. | Assessments regarding revenue systems, sales cycle efficiency, and process blueprints [2]. | To advise on revenue optimization, sales strategy, and the implementation/improvement of sales processes, ensuring a focus on business metrics like unit economics [16]. |

The structure of the resulting prompt would likely function as a sophisticated set of instructions, such as:

*   *You are [Name], the Fractional [Role]. Your personality is [Personality Traits, e.g., conservative, creative, outcome-oriented].*
*   *Your current context on the business's [Area of Expertise] is stored in this project's memory, including [list of specific assessment data, e.g., CAC, current processes, strategic plans].*
*   *When asked a question, you must reference this context and provide advice that aligns with your professional role and mindset.*

Using these AI advisors is much faster than traditional communication, saving users time and meetings [7].
