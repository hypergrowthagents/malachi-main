Interesting and Relevant Notes
- Part 1: Once done, come back and implement
- Part 2: Lessons in use

- rule: never create an empty folder or tag, until you have something to put in it. We want to avoid making empty shells that make it harder to find things
- goal is to keep all of the info you need together in one place (usually the project folder) for maximum actionability 
Tips:
- System of recognition he uses to instantly know what type of folder it is:
	- Emojis + actionable name for projects
	- Capitalized folder names for Area folders
	- Lowercase names for resource folders
- Make projects (specifically just project folder and sub folders) available offline

### Maintenance:
- Once a week, spend 5 minutes clearing out your “Inbox” folder, naming the notes better, and moving them to the most actionable place for them.
	- If they into a project, move them there
	- If they support an ongoing area of focus, move there
	- If they are more of an interest or curiosity,  move to resources 

## Projects vs Areas
- Project: a goal with a deadline
- Area: a standard to be maintained and indefinite end date
	- No particular outcome or finish to be achieved
	- Has a standard to be achieved (e.g. spend time with your kids every evening)
	- Example: finances, personal health
	- Realm of meaningful habits and things to enjoy
- Differences
	- Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility (e.g. running a marathon vs health)
	- Projects as sprints; areas as marathons
	- Projects often turn into areas once done, where there is ongoing maintenance

### Areas vs Resources
- The key is to realize the difference between things you are responsible for (areas) and things you are interested in (resources)
- Areas are the ongoing areas of your life where you must uphold a specific level of energy or performance (roles you play and hats you wear)
	- work: Newsletter, product marketing
	- personal: Spouse, parenting, finances
- Resources: include hobbies, interests and passions
	- Example: AI
	- Ask yourself if this information is useful before saving it as a resource
	- Can include assets, like images, examples, testimonials
- Areas are private whereas Resources are shareable 
	- Areas are inherently private by default
	- Learning and explore new things are inherently shareable by default

## Multiple platforms
Rules of thumb:
- Appointments = calendar
- Tasks/Action Items = to do list app
- Notes/text = note taking app
- Collaborative content = google drive 
- Fallback for other items = computer drive
- Exception = encrypted passwords go into a vault

- All platforms have the exact same structure, but only when you have something to put in it. No need to have the same folder duplicated across platforms. Extend across multiple platforms only if required

## Action Items:
1. Archive all current files. Title it with a date and put it into a larger archives folder umbrella
2. Make project folders
	1. List out all of the specific projects I have, goals, due dates
	2. Move any important files we need into these folders
3. Create other resources and area folder “as needed” right now. Don’t build them in advance of needing them - it’s a waste of time.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all of the areas I store info (Google drive, docs folder, etc.)
5. Make sure everything in areas is critically important for me to keep up. Otherwise, it might be better as a resource.
6. Ensure resources are actionable or useful in some way, so they can be applied. 
7. If a folder doesn’t have 3 items, remove the folder
