Noah Brier employs a highly effective setup that combines **Obsidian Notes with Claude Code**, primarily leveraging the PARA method for his vault structure, to function as a "true second brain" and thinking partner. Your interest in his vault structure and its implementation for effectiveness in a non-server, non-mobile context is well-aligned with the core principles he emphasizes.

Here is a step-by-step implementation plan for how to set up and utilize your Obsidian vault with Claude Code, focusing on Brier's methods for maximum effectiveness:

### Implementation Plan: Obsidian Vault Structure and Claude Code Workflow

**1. Initial Setup: Obsidian Vault and Claude Code**
*   **Obsidian Vault**: Ensure you have an Obsidian vault set up on your computer. This will serve as the local storage for all your notes, organized as markdown files and folders.
*   **Claude Code**: You will run Claude Code on top of your Obsidian vault.

**2. Adopt the PARA Method for Vault Organization**
Brier explicitly states he follows the **PARA method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for organizing his Obsidian vault.

*   **Projects**: This is where you store notes related to active endeavors with a specific outcome and deadline (e.g., a talk, a report, a new feature).
    *   **For each new project (e.g., a talk or a new idea), create a dedicated folder within your "Projects" section**. This folder will house all related research, chats, and progress notes.
*   **Areas**: For ongoing areas of responsibility that don't have a specific end date (e.g., "Marketing," "AI Strategy").
*   **Resources**: For topics or interests that you want to learn about, but are not tied to a project or area (e.g., "Quantum Physics," "Historical Figures").
*   **Archives**: For inactive projects, areas, or resources that you've completed or decided to put on hold.

**3. Project Folder Structure (Example: A Talk)**
Within each project folder, Brier creates specific sub-sections to manage his research and thinking process effectively:

*   **`chats` folder**:
    *   **Purpose**: Stores full transcripts of conversations you have with other AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok related to the project.
    *   **Implementation**: Use Obsidian's web clipper (or similar functionality) to pull entire chat transcripts directly into markdown files within this folder. This creates a comprehensive record of your AI-assisted explorations.
*   **`daily progress` note/section**:
    *   **Purpose**: A dedicated place for Claude Code to log daily learnings and progress on the project.
    *   **Implementation**: At the end of each day, instruct Claude Code to **"write up the changes that I sort of like the things I learned that day that are going to help me push this talk along"**.
*   **`research` folder**:
    *   **Purpose**: To hold all external articles, PDFs, and other reference materials relevant to the project.
    *   **Implementation**: Pull in articles and PDFs you've read or plan to read into this folder.
*   **Specific Notes (e.g., `conclusions.md`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Individual markdown files for drafting specific sections, ideas, or components of your project.
    *   **Implementation**: For instance, create a "conclusion note" where you go back and forth with Claude Code to develop your project's conclusions.

**4. Claude Code Workflow: Thinking and Research**

*   **Start Claude Code in the Root Directory**:
    *   **Crucial Step**: When you launch Claude Code, **start it in the root directory of your entire Obsidian vault**, not just the specific project folder.
    *   **Benefit**: This grants Claude Code access to your *entire* note archive, allowing it to draw connections and pull relevant information from all your past work. Claude Code has sandboxing where it can run commands inside any subfolder if started in the root.
*   **Explicitly Set "Thinking Mode" (Not Writing Mode)**:
    *   **Initial Prompt**: When starting a new project with Claude Code, **be very explicit in the front matter of your notes or in your initial prompts that you are in "thinking mode"**, not "writing mode".
    *   **Instruction**: Tell Claude Code, **"don't help me write anything right now"**. Brier uses strong language: **"I do not under any circumstances want you to try to write it. Take this literally. Do not create outlines, drafts, or any versions of talks/writing. Only gather and organize the requested materials"**.
    *   **Reasoning**: LLMs often jump to generating artifacts, but Brier emphasizes the AI's "ability to read" and help you think, which he finds "much more useful on a day-to-day basis".
*   **Provide Initial Context**:
    *   Tell Claude Code the general idea of your project, key points you want to make, and even examples of your past work to establish your style.
*   **Initial Vault Search for Relevance**:
    *   Instruct Claude Code to **"go look through all of the rest of my... Obsidian and go see anything else you can find that might be of value to this talk"**.
    *   **Benefit**: This "jumpstarts" the process by pulling existing relevant research into your project's `research` folder. Brier notes this is more effective when you've already done some thinking/research on the topic, making relevance simpler for the AI.
*   **Utilize a "Thinking Partner" Sub-Agent**:
    *   **Creation**: Brier spins up a sub-agent within Claude Code specifically designed as a **"collaborative thinking partner specializing in helping people explore complex problems"**.
    *   **Role**: This agent's primary function is to **"facilitate thinking" and "ask questions"**, not to write.
    *   **Output**: This thinking agent is instructed to **"make notes about the questions that it's asking me and keep a kind of running log of what I'm uncovering and how I'm thinking about it"**.
*   **Integrate External Chats**:
    *   Continue to have conversations with other LLMs (ChatGPT, Grok, etc.) outside of Claude Code, and **regularly pull these full transcripts into your project's `chats` folder** in Obsidian. This expands Claude Code's context for your project.
*   **Daily Progress and "Catch Me Up"**:
    *   **Regular Update**: At the end of each day, prompt Claude Code to summarize your learnings and progress.
    *   **Re-engaging with Deep Work**: When returning to a project after an interruption, ask Claude Code: **"can you catch me up on the last three days of research?"**. Claude Code will read all the recent files in the project directory, summarizing your progress and helping you regain your flow.

**5. Advanced Obsidian/Claude Code Integration (Enhancing Effectiveness)**

*   **Custom Code Commands with `package.json`**:
    *   Brier has a more "intense" Obsidian setup where he adds a `package.json` file to his vault's root directory. This allows him to add **custom code commands that can be run as slash commands within Obsidian**, extending its functionality.
    *   **Example**: He uses a custom tool that renames attachments (PDFs, images) in his `attachments` folder to more descriptive names and updates all links within his notes, running it via Gemini Flash. This demonstrates how Claude Code can automate organizational tasks within your vault.

By following these steps, you can emulate Noah Brier's highly effective approach to using Claude Code and Obsidian Notes, focusing on the structured thinking and research process within your vault, without needing to delve into server or mobile configurations. The core is leveraging Claude Code's ability to read, organize, and act as a thinking partner within a well-structured, PARA-method-based Obsidian vault.
