- Index updates
  - Replaced [[References/]] with [[03_Resources/]]
  - Added task system guidance under Task Management (distributed capture + dashboards)

Rationale:
- Preserve PARA method references and operational infrastructure
- Standardize naming for cross-platform safety and searchability
- Prevent committing local workspace and transient files
- Clarify task capture model and dashboards per OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md

Notes:
- No archiving performed at this time per guidance
- Tasks setup left intact; dashboards aggregate tasks from 01_Projects, 02_Areas, and Daily
