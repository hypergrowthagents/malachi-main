These are the key questions I want to think through with Terry:
1. Which path has the greatest likelihood of earning $20k+/mo within 3 months? 
2. Which path offers the greatest upside over the course of a year? 
3. What are the arguments against each path? 
	1. Path 1 - FT Job:
		1. Completely agrees that the traditional corporate job might be in trouble. Lots of economic signals that support my case.
		2. Plan B option: Find a fast paced agency like MAVAN - one that is more established. Where my skillset is most overlapping with what I just did.
			1. I should consider whether this would be all that different than just starting my own AI consultancy... it might be quite similar in terms of what I do.
	2. Path 2 - Advising/Consulting w/ AI capabilities:
	3. Path 3 - New company: 
		1. Likes Augmentgrowth.ai - it shows it supports/helps people. Better to underpromise and overdeliver. Thinks there is no downside in me setting up the business entity right now. I could even keep this as a side hustle.
		2. Also likes the idea of incubating this within my current network to test the idea.
		3. 
4. What is the main case for or against just setting up a new business entity right now regardless of which path I take?

## Notes:
- TLDR; Terry thinks path 3 where I start my own company is a really good idea and has a lot of upside with not a lot of downsides. It still keeps the other paths open. He also really likes the idea of starting with advising/consulting while building this company out and calibrating as I go.
- Answer the questions: What are the activities I would do over the next 90 days for each path?
	- Are there things I would do that would benefit all three paths, and that might be helpful to prioritize?
	- He's not sure I really need to do this work in light of the discussion we had today, since there seems to be a clear roadmap for this.
- Recommend I build out an economic plan for this idea, with metrics laid out of what I need to hit in order to be good financial shape. E.g. if I can't land 3 clients or X revenue by this point, I need to get more serious about a full time role. Then we'll know what we need to hit and align on the plan.
	- What costs do I need to build in?
	2. Customer acquisition costs
- My target market: Series A-C companies who are well funded and investing ample money in paid acquisition.
- Anecdote: his time consulting he learned:
	- Lay out the common problems
	- These are the solutions
	- These are the case studies
	- Here's how we could solve it
- Pitch to Danielle: there are no greater time wasters than applying to job postings. You are dealing with cold outreach. One of the best paths is working warm relationships and using my advising/new business as a foot in the door.
- Sales strategy:
	- Really likes my networking outreach approach pitch:
		- "Hey, I just left MAVAN to go start my own thing at the intersection of growth and AI, doing XYZ. I've always really respected your expertise and I'd love to pick your brain on it if you have a few mins. And we can catch up!"
	- As for whether to talk to them about advising or the growth platform, talking about both is fine. Get their take on it. Maybe either connects with them.

## Action Items:

1. Talk to Danielle on the approach
2. Get the domain setup (augmentgrowth.ai)
3. Write up the vision doc
4. Build a 1-2 year financial plan
5. Build the pitch via website wireframe
6. Set up an LLC
7. Keep finances separate and save good records
