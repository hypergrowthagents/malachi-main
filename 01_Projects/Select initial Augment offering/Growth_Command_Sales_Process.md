---

## Strategic Approach

**Lead with Growth Command, architect for Full Augment expansion**

## Discovery Framework: The Pipeline Attribution Angle

### Opening Question Sequence

1. **Attribution Reality Check**
   - "When you look at your $80K monthly spend, what percentage can you definitively tie to closed deals in your CRM?"
   - Expected answer: <20% (creates immediate tension)

2. **Time Waste Quantification**
   - "How much time does your team spend reconciling marketing metrics with sales pipeline data?"
   - Expected answer: 8-12 hours weekly

3. **Monday Morning Pain Point**
   - "What happens in your Monday morning marketing meetings when the CEO asks 'which campaigns drove last week's demos?'"
   - Expected answer: Scrambling, guesswork, frustration

4. **Value Proposition Setup**
   - "If I showed you exactly which keywords and audiences generate MQLs that actually close, what would that be worth?"
   - Expected answer: Significantly more than $5,500/month

### Quantification Questions

**Revenue Impact Discovery:**
- "What's your average deal size?" → Establishes value of proper attribution
- "How many deals monthly come from paid acquisition?" → Sizes the opportunity
- "How much budget gets reallocated monthly based on gut feel vs. data?" → Usually 20-30%

**Operational Pain Discovery:**
- "Who currently handles attribution analysis?" → Usually scattered across team
- "How confident is your team in pipeline attribution accuracy?" → Usually <50%
- "What tools do you use for cross-channel performance analysis?" → Usually inadequate

## Value Demonstration Script

### The "Pipeline Clarity" Positioning

**Opening Value Statement:**
"You're spending $80K monthly - that's nearly $1M annually - and operating with last-click attribution. That's like navigating with a compass when competitors have GPS."

**Specific Deliverables Timeline:**
- **Week 1**: Complete attribution audit showing true revenue contribution by campaign
- **Week 2**: Identify $15-20K in wasted spend (we guarantee finding at least $15K)
- **Week 4**: Pipeline-connected dashboard showing marketing → demo → close journey
- **Week 8**: 20-30% improvement in pipeline-generating efficiency

**ROI Framework:**
"At $5,500/month, we pay for ourselves by recovering just 7% of your spend. Most clients see 15-30% waste elimination within 60 days."

### Mathematical Certainty Approach

**Attribution Blindspot Reveal:**
"With $80K spend and last-click attribution, you're mathematically guaranteed to have 15-30% misallocated budget. Here's why..."

**Specific GA4 Limitations to Highlight:**
1. 7-day lookback window misses longer B2B cycles
2. Cross-device attribution gaps in complex buyer journeys
3. Assisted conversion undervaluation
4. Platform-specific attribution conflicts

## Proof Points Strategy

### Without Case Studies: "Calculated Confidence"

**1. Mathematical Certainty**
- Show attribution model comparison charts
- Reference industry studies on GA4 limitations
- Demonstrate waste calculation methodology

**2. Live Tool Stack Validation**
- Screen share their actual GA4 during call
- Point out specific blindspots in real-time
- Show attribution discrepancies in their data

**3. Competitive Intelligence**
- Reference public case studies from similar B2B SaaS companies
- Industry benchmark data for attribution improvements
- Publicly available tool limitation studies

**4. Personal Expertise Positioning**
- "I've analyzed over $10M in ad spend using these exact methodologies"
- Reference specific patterns found in B2B SaaS attribution
- Technical methodology explanations demonstrating depth

## Objection Handling Matrix

### "Why not hire an analytics person?"

**Response Framework:**
"A senior analyst costs $120K+ annually ($10K/month) plus benefits, tools, and ramp time. You'll wait 3-6 months for insights we deliver in week one. Plus, we bring cross-client pattern recognition no single analyst can match."

**Supporting Points:**
- Time to value: Immediate vs 3-6 months
- Cost comparison: $5,500 vs $10K+ monthly
- Expertise depth: Cross-client learning vs single-company view
- Tool mastery: Pre-built vs learning curve

### "Our agency should handle this"

**Response Framework:**
"Agencies optimize for what they can see - usually platform metrics. They're not connecting to your CRM, analyzing pipeline attribution, or identifying cross-channel cannibalization. We complement agencies by making them more effective with better data."

**Supporting Points:**
- Agency limitations: Platform-focused vs pipeline-focused
- Complementary value: Makes existing agency more effective
- Data depth: CRM integration vs surface metrics
- Conflict of interest: Agency spend optimization vs true ROI

### "We need to see results first"

**Response Framework:**
"Absolutely. That's why we offer a 30-day performance guarantee. If we don't identify at least $15K in monthly wasted spend, you get a full refund. We're that confident in our methodology."

**Risk Reversal Elements:**
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Specific performance threshold ($15K waste identification)
- Low-risk pilot approach available
- Success metrics clearly defined

## Closing Sequence Framework

### The "Collaborative Close"

**Setup Phase:**
"Based on our discussion, it sounds like attribution clarity and pipeline visibility are your immediate priorities. Growth Command solves both for $5,500/month."

**Option Close:**
"Should we start with a 30-day pilot to prove the value, or would you prefer to commit quarterly for the $1,500 performance bonus opportunity?"

**Timeline Close:**
"I can have your first attribution audit ready by next Monday - would that timing work for your team?"

### Alternative Closing Approaches

**Assumption Close:**
"When should we schedule the technical setup call to get your data access configured?"

**Challenge Close:**
"What would need to happen internally for you to move forward with this level of attribution clarity?"

**Summary Close:**
"So we're solving the Monday Morning Forensics problem, identifying $15K+ waste monthly, and giving you pipeline visibility for $5,500/month with a guarantee. What questions do I need to answer?"
