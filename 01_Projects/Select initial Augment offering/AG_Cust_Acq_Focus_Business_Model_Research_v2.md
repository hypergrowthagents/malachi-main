## Derek Steer Call Insights (2025-09-30)

### **Key Strategic Learnings**

**PostHog Positioning Playbook:**
- Don't differentiate on value prop (cheaper/faster/better) - everyone claims that
- **Differentiate on IDENTITY and HOW you communicate**
- PostHog doesn't claim to be "better than Segment" - claims to be "FOR YOU" (engineers)
- Narrow market until 100% consistency in desires and messaging preferences

**Guarantee Positioning Critique:**
- Performance guarantees have been promised before - message needs differentiation
- Guarantees are "overused and people are skeptical"
- Guarantees help conversion but won't convince uninterested prospects
- **Recommendation:** Keep guarantee as risk reversal tool, don't lead with it in positioning

**Market Narrowing Strategy:**
- "Subsegment until you find a segment that is 100% consistent in their desires and messaging preferences"
- Talk to 25 people in target audience to validate positioning
- Offered Clay credits for prospect research

**Homework from Derek:**
- Conduct 25 customer interviews to validate positioning
- Focus on identity (who it's for) + unique value (what makes it different)
- Build positioning around audience identity, not just product capabilities

## 2. TARGET MARKET & ICP

### **Primary Vertical Focus: Consumer AI/SaaS + Consumer Fintech**

**Target Companies:**
- **Consumer AI/SaaS:** Prosumer subscription products (like 11 Labs, Fireflies, productivity tools, AI editors)
- **Consumer Fintech:** Personal finance apps, budgeting tools, investment apps, payment products
- **Consumer Subscription Apps:** Education platforms, content services, productivity tools

**Why These Verticals:**
-  Personal expertise (11 Labs, Fireflies background)
-  High creative intensity (creative-heavy channels like Meta, TikTok)
-  Clear CAC metrics (consumer motion with fast conversion cycles)
-  Venture funding (easier to sell premium pricing)
-  AI appreciation (don't need to explain AI value proposition)
-  No incumbent competition (emerging categories without established agencies)
-  High margins (software/subscription vs. physical goods)

### **ICP Characteristics (Updated 9/30):**

**Company Stage:**
- Seed-stage ($1-5M raised, 6-18 months from Series A)
- $1M-5M ARR with proven PMF, scaling customer acquisition
- 10-30 employees, 2-5 marketing team members

**Ad Spend Profile:**
- $50-150K monthly ad spend
- Currently using Meta, Google, TikTok, or YouTube
- Sub-$50/month subscription products (consumer motion, not enterprise)

**Decision Maker Profile - The Operator (NOT the Technical Founder):**
- **Role:** CEO/COO who came up through operations, not engineering
- **Mindset:** Think in systems, not campaigns - build processes, not one-off projects
- **Speed:** Move fast, iterate daily, don't wait for perfect data
- **Data-driven:** Love dashboards, metrics, closed feedback loops

- Percentage scales as spend increases: 10% � 8% � 6% � 5%
- 60-day evaluation period with guarantee
- Client pays full fees during evaluation, can request refund if unsatisfied

### **The 15% CAC Improvement Guarantee**

**Target:** 15% CAC improvement in first 60 days

**Refund Tiers (Client's Option to Request):**

| CAC Improvement | Client Can Request | You Keep (Minimum) | Outcome |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **15%+** | No refund eligible | 100% ($10K on $50K spend) | Client thrilled, continues |
| **10-14%** | 25% refund ($2.5K) | 75% ($7.5K) | Client decides: keep or refund |

- **Months 1-2:** $5K/month ($10K total during 60-day evaluation)
- **Result:** 11% CAC improvement, client expected more
- **Refund:** Client requests 25% refund ($2.5K)
- **Outcome:** You keep $7.5K, client may continue or cancel

**Client D: $70K monthly spend**
- **Months 1-2:** $7K/month ($14K total during 60-day evaluation)
- **Result:** 6% CAC improvement
- **Refund:** Client requests 50% refund ($7K)
- **Outcome:** You keep $7K (covers costs), client likely cancels

### **Scaled Pricing Structure:**

**As client spend increases, percentage decreases:**

| Monthly Media Spend | Percentage | Monthly Fee | Annual Value |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| $40-75K | 10% | $4-7.5K | $48-90K |
| $75-150K | 8% | $6-12K | $72-144K |
| $150-300K | 6% | $9-18K | $108-216K |

## 7. COMPETITIVE MOAT STRATEGY

### **Year 1: Near-Term Moats (Months 1-12)**

**1. Systematic Delivery Process IP**
- Document exact framework for CAC improvement
- Templatize: Audit � Baseline � Optimization � Testing � Iteration
- Proprietary scoring system for channel health (0-100 score with component breakdown)
- Repeatable playbooks by vertical and platform
- **Defensibility:** Process IP can be codified in agents, harder to replicate than ad hoc consulting

**2. Case Study Compound Effect**
- Target: 10-15 case studies with measurable CAC improvements (15-30% improvements)
- Vertical-specific results ("We've improved CAC for 8 Consumer AI brands by average 23%")
- Network effects: Clients refer similar companies in same vertical
- **Defensibility:** Social proof creates sales flywheel, incumbency advantage

**3. Vertical Creative Intelligence**
- Library of winning creative patterns by industry (Consumer AI, Consumer Fintech)
- "We've analyzed 500+ Consumer AI ads to identify 12 high-performing creative frameworks"
- New clients get immediate benefit of aggregated learnings
- **Defensibility:** Data advantage compounds over time, first-mover in vertical

**4. Agent Capabilities as Black Box**
- Clients don't see agents, just results ("proprietary intelligence systems")
- Harder to replicate "Augment's system" vs. "AI tools anyone can access"
- Similar to how Google's algorithm is defensible through complexity + continuous improvement
- **Defensibility:** Perceived complexity and mystique around systematic delivery

---

### **Year 2: Medium-Term Moats (Months 12-24)**

**5. Platform Network Effects**
- Data from 20+ clients improves agent performance for all clients
- Creative testing data creates prediction models (which hooks/CTAs work best)
- Audience insights compound across similar brands
- **Defensibility:** Platform becomes more valuable with each new client (network effects)

**6. Integration Depth**
- Deep platform integrations (Meta Marketing API, TikTok Ads API, Google Ads API)
- Proprietary data pipelines that take months to replicate
- Agent systems that span multiple platforms in coordinated fashion
- **Defensibility:** Technical complexity and platform relationships create barriers

**7. Vertical Community/Content**
- Become thought leader in Consumer AI customer acquisition
- Build community of Consumer AI growth marketers using insights
- Content moat: "Augment's 2025 Consumer AI Customer Acquisition Benchmarks Report"
- **Defensibility:** Category ownership and brand recognition

---

### **Year 3+: Long-Term Moats (Months 24+)**

**8. Platform with Switching Costs**
- Self-serve platform where clients build workflows on infrastructure
- Historical data and agent training specific to each client
- Pain to migrate to competitor after 12+ months of data and workflows
- **Defensibility:** High switching costs once embedded in client operations

**9. Vertical M&A/Talent**
- Acquire small agencies specializing in Consumer AI or Fintech
- Hire top Consumer AI growth marketers who bring client relationships
- Vertical consolidation play (become dominant player in niche)
- **Defensibility:** Consolidation and talent acquisition create market dominance

**10. Data Aggregation Advantage**
- Proprietary dataset of 50K+ Consumer AI ad creatives with performance data
- Competitive intelligence across entire vertical (all Consumer AI brands tracked)
- Becomes industry infrastructure (like how Nielsen owns TV data)
- **Defensibility:** Unique data asset, becomes "table stakes" to compete in vertical

---

## 8. GUARANTEE RISK MITIGATION

### **De-Risking Tactics:**

**1. Start with 1-2 Discounted Pilots (Months 1-2)**
- **Offer:** "$5K pilot - let's test if we can improve your CAC"
- **No guarantee:** Just "let's see what's possible"
- **Purpose:** Validate agent capabilities, refine process, build initial case studies
- **Outcome:** If successful, transition to guarantee model for future clients

**2. Conservative Guarantee Targets**
- **Start with 15% improvement** (not 25-30%)
- **OR offer flexibility:** "15% CAC improvement OR 40% volume increase at same CAC"
- **Purpose:** Gives multiple paths to success, reduces binary risk

**3. Strict Client Qualification**
- **Minimum $40K monthly spend** (need enough data to optimize)
- **At least 3 months of historical data** (establish reliable baseline)
- **Willingness to implement creative recommendations** (client must execute)
- **Attribution measurement capability** (must be able to measure results)
- **No attribution black holes** (if they can't measure CAC accurately, don't take them)

**4. Partial Guarantee Structure (Client-Activated)**
- **15%+ improvement:** No refund eligible (full fees kept)
- **10-14% improvement:** 25% refund if client requests (you keep 75%)
- **5-9% improvement:** 50% refund if client requests (you keep 50%)
- **<5% improvement:** 75% refund if client requests (you keep 25%)
- **Negative improvement:** Automatic 100% refund
- **Purpose:** Sliding scale reduces binary risk, protects you from "happy client at 12% improvement"

**5. Escape Clauses (Contract Language)**
- **"Guarantee requires client to implement recommendations within 7 business days"**
  - If client delays or ignores recommendations, guarantee void
- **"Guarantee requires minimum data quality standards"**
  - If client's tracking is broken or data is unreliable, guarantee void
- **"Guarantee excludes platform algorithm changes outside our control"**
  - If Meta changes algorithm and tanks all advertisers, not your fault
- **"CAC improvement measured on apples-to-apples basis"**
  - Same attribution model, same conversion window, same platforms

- ** CONTINUE:** If 70%+ client success rate, scale to 8-10 clients
- **� PIVOT:** If <50% client success rate, investigate what's broken (guarantee too aggressive? wrong clients? agent capabilities insufficient?)
- **L STOP:** If unable to deliver results consistently, return to drawing board

## 10. KEY STRATEGIC QUESTIONS & OPEN ISSUES

### **Resolved Questions:**

 **Positioning:** "The Customer Acquisition Guarantee" - clear, compelling, differentiating
 **Target vertical:** Consumer AI/SaaS + Consumer Fintech - aligned with expertise and passion
 **Pricing model:** Client-activated money-back guarantee (60 days, tiered refunds) - protects both sides
 **Capacity:** 2-3 clients solo, scale with fractional PM support - realistic
 **Agent build sequence:** Core CAC � Creative Intelligence � Analytics � Platform - systematic
 **Moat strategy:** Process IP, case studies, vertical intelligence, platform network effects - compound over time

### **Outstanding Questions:**

**1. Which specific Consumer AI sub-vertical to start?**
- Prosumer productivity tools (Notion AI, Grammarly-like)?
- Consumer content creation (11 Labs, Runway-like)?
- AI personal assistants (Fireflies, Otter-like)?
- **Action:** Interview 5-10 Consumer AI companies in next 30 days to identify highest-pain sub-vertical

**2. How to handle clients with messy attribution?**
- Many Consumer AI companies have multi-touch attribution challenges (organic + paid interaction)
- Guarantee harder to prove if attribution is unclear
- **Option A:** Only take clients with clean attribution (Meta/TikTok only, no cross-channel complexity)
- **Option B:** Set up proper attribution as part of engagement (add 2 weeks to timeline)
- **Action:** Decide attribution threshold for client qualification

**3. Should we offer "New Channel Launch" service tier in Year 1?**
- Different from CAC improvement guarantee (no baseline to improve)
- Could be lucrative (clients want to test TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- Distracts from core positioning
- **Recommendation:** Wait until Month 6-9, after core guarantee model proven

**4. How aggressive should pilot pricing be?**
- $5K for 60-day pilot (no guarantee) - attractive but low margin
- $7.5K for 60-day pilot (partial guarantee) - still discounted but better margin
- **Action:** Test both approaches with first 2-3 prospects, see what closes

**5. When to bring in technical co-founder or agent builder?**
- Solo agent building works for Tier 1-2 agents (research, analysis, recommendations)
- Need technical help for production API integrations, data pipelines
- **Recommendation:** Hire part-time technical contractor at Month 6-9 ($5-8K/month)

## 11. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Next 30 Days)

### **Customer Discovery Sprint**

**Goal:** Interview 10-15 Consumer AI and Consumer Fintech companies to validate positioning and pricing

**Questions to validate:**
1. Current CAC challenges and acquisition strategy
2. Interest in performance guarantee model (would 15% CAC improvement in 60 days be compelling?)
3. Pricing sensitivity (would they pay 10% of spend for guaranteed results?)
4. Decision timeline (how fast could they move on $5-10K/month decision?)
5. Vertical concentration (which Consumer AI sub-vertical has most acute pain?)

**Target outcomes:**
-  70%+ say performance guarantee is compelling
-  50%+ would consider 10% of spend pricing reasonable
-  Identify specific Consumer AI sub-vertical to focus (productivity, content creation, or assistants)
-  Validate 60-day timeline is acceptable (vs. 90 days)

---

### **Technical Validation**

**Goal:** Build 2-3 core AI agents and validate systematic delivery capability

**Agents to build (Months 1-2):**
1. **ICP Research Engine** - Pull customer insights from Reddit, Twitter, FB groups for a test Consumer AI company
2. **Campaign Health Monitor** - Connect to Meta Ads API, set up performance threshold tracking
3. **Creative Performance Predictor** - Test AI evaluation of creative concepts (predict CTR/engagement)

**Validation criteria:**
-  Agents can run autonomously with minimal manual intervention
-  Output quality is actionable (not generic AI slop)
-  Time savings vs. manual execution is significant (50%+ time savings)

---

### **Business Model Testing**

**Goal:** Design pilot program structure and validate with 1-2 discounted clients

**Pilot program structure:**
- **Offer:** "$5K for 60-day customer acquisition test - let's prove we can improve your CAC"
- **Deliverables:** Audit � Optimization � Testing � 60-day results analysis
- **No guarantee:** Just "let's test what's possible" (lower risk for first clients)
- **Transition:** If successful, transition to full pricing ($5-10K/month ongoing)

**Target outcomes:**
-  Close 1-2 pilot clients in next 30 days
-  Validate agent capabilities can deliver 15%+ CAC improvement
-  Document systematic process for CAC improvement (not just "Malachi magic")
-  Build case studies for guarantee launch

---

### **Positioning & Marketing**

**Goal:** Finalize positioning, build landing page, start outbound

**Deliverables:**
-  Landing page with "The Customer Acquisition Guarantee" positioning
-  Case study template for documenting results
-  Outbound email sequence for Consumer AI prospects
-  LinkedIn content strategy (2-3 posts per week on CAC optimization, Consumer AI growth)

**Target outcomes:**
-  Landing page live with clear guarantee positioning
-  50+ outbound emails sent to Consumer AI prospects
-  5-10 discovery calls booked
-  1-2 pilot clients closed

## APPENDIX A: Archived Positioning Approaches

### **Original "Customer Acquisition Guarantee" Positioning (Pre-Derek Call)**

**Archived Date:** 2025-09-30 (Post-Derek Steer Call)

**Why Archived:** Derek advised that performance guarantees are "overused and people are skeptical." Positioning should differentiate on identity and communication style (PostHog playbook), not just performance claims. Guarantee kept as optional risk reversal tool, not primary positioning.

**Original Headline:** "The Customer Acquisition Guarantee"

**Original Subheadline:** "15% CAC improvement in 60 days, or you can request a refund. Then we scale your growth without the team overhead."

**Original Body Copy:**
*"Stop gambling on customer acquisition. We guarantee measurable CAC improvements or you can request a refund. Our systematic approach combines proprietary intelligence systems with growth marketing expertise - so you get the results without the AI headaches.*

*After proving results, we become your AI-augmented growth team. Scale customer acquisition without hiring 10 specialists. Get the strategic insights, creative velocity, and optimization expertise of a full team - for a fraction of the cost."*

**Original Positioning Evolution:**
- **Months 1-3:** Performance guarantee positioning (cuts through noise, proves value)
- **Months 4-12:** AI-augmented growth team (systematic delivery, expansion)
- **Months 13-18:** Growth intelligence platform (vertical specialization)

**What We Learned:**
- Guarantee messaging is compelling for conversion but doesn't build category differentiation
- Need to lead with WHO it's for and HOW we're different, not just WHAT we promise
- Operators respond to identity-based positioning ("this is for people like you") more than feature claims
- Keep guarantee as conversion tool, not positioning hook

## APPENDIX B: Strategic Analysis from Business Partner & Product Marketing Strategist Agents

### **Key Insights from Agent Analysis:**

**Business Partner Insights:**
- Performance guarantees fundamentally broken at scale - CAC inflation inevitable as spend increases
- Percentage of spend model superior for venture scaling - recurring revenue grows with client success
- Recommends hybrid: Prove value with guarantee first, then transition to percentage model
- Unit economics favor percentage model - client going $500K → $5M spend = $150K+ ARR

**Product Marketing Strategist Insights:**
- Guarantee positioning creates strongest differentiation - cuts through "AI-powered marketing" noise
- Message clarity winner: "Guaranteed customers in 30 days" requires zero market education
- Original "Augment Growth" positioning too similar to commodity AI marketing tools
- Suggests tiered guarantee structure to handle scaling conflicts

**Strategic Tension Resolution:**
Both agents independently arrived at same solution: **Use performance guarantees for positioning and acquisition, transition to percentage model for sustainability.**

**Update (2025-09-30):** Derek Steer's insights refined this further - use guarantee as conversion tool, not positioning lead. Focus on identity (operators who move at AI speed) and communication style (transparent, systematic, fast) for differentiation.
