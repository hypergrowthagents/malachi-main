# Project Progress - Select Initial Augment Offering

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** #in-progress

---

## Current Focus

Positioning Augment Growth as **AI-Augmented Customer Acquisition for Operators** - service offering v4 now emphasizes identity-based differentiation (operator mindset) over performance guarantees.

---

## Recent Decisions (Latest First)

- **2025-09-30**: Shifted from guarantee-led positioning to identity-based positioning following Derek Steer call (PostHog playbook)
- **2025-09-30**: Created comprehensive Philosophy document explaining human+AI collaboration approach
- **2025-09-30**: Refined ICP to operator profile (CEO/COO with ops background, systems thinkers, AI-native)
- **2025-09-29**: Pivoted from broad "AI overhaul" positioning to customer acquisition focus
- **2025-09-28**: Deprioritized anti-AI premium pricing strategy - market too small/unviable

---

## What's Been Tried

**Positioning Approaches:**
- ✗ **Anti-AI premium segment** - Market too narrow, positioning too defensive (archived as Research_Phase_3)
- ✗ **Guarantee-led positioning** - Derek feedback: overused, skeptical reception, doesn't differentiate
- ✓ **Customer acquisition focus** - Strong signal, aligns with operator pain points
- ✓ **Identity-based positioning** - PostHog playbook, differentiate on WHO and HOW vs. WHAT

**Service Offering Evolution:**
- v1 → v2 → v3 → **v4** (current: operator-focused, systematic intelligence, closed-loop transparency)
- Business model evolved from Morpheus platform to service-first approach
- Pricing: 10% of spend model with tiered scaling (vs. flat retainers)

## Active Threads

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Conduct 25 customer discovery calls to validate operator positioning (Derek homework)
- [ ] Finalize Customer Discovery Call Framework
- [ ] Prepare audit/proposal template for prospect engagement

**Documentation In Progress:**
- Service_Offerings_v4.md - comprehensive offering with operator positioning
- Philosophy.md - human+AI collaboration philosophy
- Customer_Discovery_Call_Framework.md - interview structure

**Deprioritized/Archived:**
- ICP_Exploration_AI_Overhaul - moved to _Deprioritized suffix
- Research_Phase_3_Anti-AI_Premium - moved to Research_ prefix

## Key Strategic Insights

**PostHog Playbook (Derek Steer):**
- Differentiate on identity and communication style, not just product claims
- Subsegment until 100% consistency in desires and messaging preferences
- Don't lead with "better/faster/cheaper" - lead with "built FOR YOU"

**Operator Positioning:**
- Target CEO/COO with ops background (not first-time founders)
- Emphasize systems thinking, transparency, velocity, AI-native mindset
- Communication: async-first, push intelligence, closed-loop visibility

**Competitive Moat:**
- Systematic delivery process (hypothesis → result → learning → next move)
- Vertical creative intelligence (Consumer AI/Fintech specific)
- Pattern discovery that compounds over time
- Operator-grade transparency (vs. agency black boxes)

## Next Session Pickup

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Review/finalize Customer Discovery Call Framework
2. Begin customer discovery outreach (target: 25 calls)
3. Validate operator positioning hypothesis through interviews
4. Refine messaging based on call feedback

**Questions to Explore:**
- Which customer acquisition channels to lead with? (Meta vs. Google Search for AI companies)
- How to balance human-in-the-loop scaling vs. automation as client base grows?
- Platform timing: when to transition from service → self-serve platform?
