Option 1 - “I teach teams how to use AI powered growth marketing strategies”

Option 2 - “I run AI-powered growth marketing strategies for you.”

- People want to buy my growth knowledge, not my limited AI knowledge. Even if I could sell my AI knowledge, I’m not sure if I could follow through on the delivery.
- Therefore, it’s critical I use my growth consulting to beef up experience in building AI growth systems and using it as proof of concept for offering AI systems to others.
- The number of companies getting into the AI automation space is exploding and the number of AI tools/capabilities is too. People don’t value someone building them an AI workflow that much. They want the AI strategy- what are the exact systems, tools and workflows they can build that changes the game in terms of their growth structure.
	- Maybe I should be designing the systems vs. building them. Architect the structure and help companies implement it
- Validate these main directions to focus on. Determine which pain point is the most resonant
	- AI strategy: figuring out what to implement and how. Designing the system
	- AI implementation: implementing the workflows
	- Growth strategy: figuring of how to improve a company’s growth trajectory 
	- Growth Execution + AI: I run the paid acquisition for or with them using AI and then teach them how to bring that capability in house (e.g. how to run it with Claude code)
- I should just start cranking on AI powered growth agents/apps, and figure out what makes it possible for me to easily manage 10 clients in parallel (that would be disruptive as an offer for paid execution). 
	- Focus only on the agents that are most valuable in helping with execution. Remove the fluff and more random experiment ideas, in order to avoid going down multi day rabbit holes for unknown reasons.
- I need to get out of over analyzing this and figure out the opportunities by seeing it in action. For example, if I can get great UGC videos in little time investment, I can use or sell that easily.
- I think the best execution of growth with AI will get commoditized, so you probably don’t want to be stuck selling that. Strategy and knowledge of how to use AI most effectively is going to be prized. So I have to prove that I know what to build and can build it, creating a one many army and operating at a high quality.
- People will expect my services to be faster and cheaper due to AI commodization. That’s why I shouldn’t sell the AI aspects of this perhaps, as it may cheapen my offering. To Danielle’s point, I don’t have to sell the AI… I could just as easily to do the work of more clients or roles in order to generate value. Learn how to 5x myself. 
- Big picture brainstorming question: How could I manage 20 clients without increasing my workload by much? What capabilities would I need to have? 
	- Action: map this out.
- Figure out if I am better off building these workflows in Claude code or with n8n. Or piloting them with CC and then rolling them out as modular n8n components, which can be easily copy and pasted. What would be the advantage of each approach?

## Services Roadmap Evolution

### Stage 1: MVP

1. Start with growth consulting (for income)
2. Add in at least one client I test implementing AI growth processes for, which can be free or very cheap. (E.g. Barlow’s company)
	1. Start by automating workflows in Claude Code. 
	2. Then either port those over to n8n or teach them how to use the Claude code workflow

There is a chicken or egg problem with my services pitch - I’ll need to have some co finance I can actually build and deliver the value offered in stage 2 before I start hard selling it. Or I could build the phase 2 offer and get interest to test it out (following the advice to test distribution before building).

Pre-requisite: I need to find some guinea pig clients to build this for.

I could test this out with clients like DMS and Owner.com. The pitch would be that I’ll work alongside their team and help implement AI powered processes and workflows. We’ll know them out one by one. Give them a list of the types of agents I plan to build anyway that ladder up into “running paid growth marketing” effectively.

Then focus on building the highest priority processes and systematically go through them.

Important: in stage 1, I’m doing a combined growth advising/consulting plus developing AI workflows for them. This is how I bootstrap my experience and library of agents into stage 2. Without this, I will have a hard time selling the embedded AI processes on their own. I have to graduate to that once I have a proven foundation I can offer and build on that there is proven demand for.
### Stage 2:
What do I want things to look like once I’ve proven them out in testing phase?

Options:
1. I could come in and run growth “alongside” your team and teach you team how to implement and run ai powered growth processes. Essentially I am designing and teaching the system as I embed in your team and helping you implement the processes. Possibly helping guide you to customize them for your own purposes.
2. I could run the AI powered growth for you. This is the agency angle. I could hire and train people to do my method, similar to number one. This might be better to roll out as a stage 3 offering, although there’s nothing preventing me from taking steps in stage 2 to get this in place by finding someone in my network and teaching them the process.

Option 1 sounds more attractive. Maybe that’s a 3 month process. 

Downside of option 1 is that it doesn’t have a lot of recurring revenue. Clients churn and have to be refilled (same as fletch model). The recurring rev might come from option 2 and the smaller percentage who pick me to run their growth.

Upside of option 1 is that it appeals to upmarket companies that already have performance marketers, they have more budget, I can help upskill people, I can augment/integrate into their workflows vs forcing my own. I can do this solo - I don’t need anyone else from a resource perspective to embed and train their team.

I also like that each time I embed with a company and help them implement AI into their workflows, I add a new module/playbook to my arsenal that increases the value of what I can deliver to the next client. And I have the flexibility to update/adapt processes over time as I implement them with teams each time.

What might option 1 include?
- Live training sessions, team and 1:1 (could adjust price based on # of people); hands on 
- Learn to use Claude code
- Prebuilt workflows for:
	- meta and Google ads analysis and optimization
	- AI creative production
	- N8n workflows

Positioning might include: “what could your team accomplish if they had 50% of their time back?” Scale up? New channels? Layer in more sophistication? It’s not about replacement… it’s about expansion… helping small teams grow and deliver more value.

### Stage 3:
Expansion:
- Add some recurring subscription option that has me on to support and update implementations over time as a monthly ongoing cost (maybe $1-2k).
- E.g. I’ll send you monthly updates to new workflows I’m building and updates to previous versions. Cancel anytime.

Agency:
- Expand agency offering where into growth for you with better cost and speed than traditional agencies. Steal share from the paid media agency landscape.
- Continue to iterate and refine the agents and workflows being used.

### Stage 4:
TBD if we ever reach this stage, but in theory, I could start to spin out agents I’ve built into apps that others can use, especially other agencies. And charge an ongoing subscription price for them, which could be a recurring revenue stream.

This would turn me into a software company though, so this would require bringing on more engineering/technical resources that can ship production grade software. Or offering very lightweight apps at low costs. 

What would my distribution advantage be though? I would need to have built up a large community or have a high enough LTV to do paid ads.

Lots of issues with this stage. This is essentially what Web Gremlin tried to do and seemed to fail to deliver a great product. I could have a bunch of mediocre products like this that require a lot of upkeep and don’t generate a lot of money.

Instead, it would probably be smarter to pick the top 1 or 2 agents I have worked on that solve the biggest problem or generate the most impact, and focus energy on exploiting those.

## Mission

==**My mission is to enable growth teams to fully leverage AI to scale efficiently.**==

**Pitch**: I’ll help your team transition to AI-first growth marketing processes in 90 days.
- we’ll set you up with an advanced AI growth system in 90 days

**Hypotheses/Key Assumptions:**
- Companies are desperately in need of figuring out how to evolve their teams and processes to be AI powered in order to unlock ROI and scale.
- There aren’t many good options available to help companies make that transition. They are left on their own to develop their own capabilities and navigate it alone. There is a huge learning curve and time investment tax to doing this alone.
- Existing solutions are generally limited to:
	- AI tools/software - thousand of point solutions being developed that solve very specific needs, but there are hundreds/thousands of options and no one to run them
	- Custom AI implementations - workflow builders and technical agencies that we set up the scaffolding of agents for you, but focus purely on the technical workflows
	- AI strategy consultants - can help you identify the needs and offer development partners to build solutions, but don’t specifically have subject matter expertise in growth marketing
	- Agencies that will take in all of the execution for growth, but won’t teach you or help implement any internal competitive advantages 
- The gap: companies need someone who knows both AI and growth marketing, who can implement AI strategies aligned to growth needs, who can speed up time wasted on figuring it out alone, and who can leave a lasting foundations for AI processes that startups can build upon.

**Outcomes**:
1. Team is self sufficient in using Ai for growth within 90 days. Team learns how to integrate AI into their workflows and has access/training on how to use it effectively. 
2. Improved operating cadence - Operating cadence improves from weekly/monthly to daily (need to define this point better)
3. Improved results for paid acquisition (need to pull this from case studies that develop with early clients)
	1. E.g. CAC improved by 40% in 6 weeks by implementing daily ad cuts and creative refresh cycle
4. Systems have been established that team can use to operate common growth workflows within 90 days

**How do I do that?**
I embed into your team, understand your current growth strategy, and figure out the highest impact ways to implement AI to enhance your work.

- Starts out with an assessment
	- Includes short, medium, and long term AI roadmap for growth
- Prioritize which tools and processes to implement first
- Establish baseline AI capabilities across the team (Claude code)
- Develop SOPs of priority processes > make PRDs
- Partner with existing team to make collaborative MVPs that solve the core use case
	- These are “baseline implementations” that can be refined and scaled over time, not perfection. We are going to speed and impact over polish
- If I have an existing workflow already built, I’ll help the team implement it pretty quickly, with guidelines for how to improve/customize it further
- If I don’t have a workflow already built, we’ll develop the MVP together 
- By end of 90 days, team should have at least 5 baseline workflows implemented based on prioritization
- These workflows are focused on helping to scale paid growth
	- Anything outside of that (e.g. custom needs) would be out of scope and/or discussed as ad hoc additions. This keeps me from going down random rabbit holes where my knowledge is not scaled for that deliverable and I’m having to design from scratch a lot or it wouldn’t be valuable to leverage for the next client

**What is delivered:**
(List of potential growth agents we build together as an example of what the outputs would be)

“I’m delivering the strategies, processes, and automations that the top companies use to fuel growth.”

The system will be designed using semi-automated processes with AI that have been reverse-engineered from the strategies used by top growth teams. 

### Growth strategies:
The strategies of top growth teams include:

- Daily granular optimizations/stop loss
- Dynamic LTV and ability to granular value user segments
- Reverse engineering competitive strategies (creative, placements, channels)
- Channel diversification 
- Weekly creative testing
- Incrementality measurement
- Attribution confidence

**Cost**: 
$45k for 3 months (discounted for first 2-5 clients to more like $22.5-$30k)

### Landing Page:
Build a landing page assessment just as described by Daniel Priestly here: https://youtu.be/az1Zh-FNSno?si=lHOxWzQKZQtvL2Z-


- I need to shift the pitch from helping them implement processes to instead be implementing a proven system
- Define what the system is (the specific collection of agents) and what those agents do
	- Important point: the system is not the AI, but rather the proven growth methods (my unique value), which are automated and enabled by AI in order for anyone to be able to leverage their power
- Define the outcomes you get from using the system and why this more than pays for itself
- It’s ok if the system isn’t built yet/is a bit aspirational. My next state will be to build out key pieces of this system and move towards the value prop of having the system

Top questions: 
what do people want the most? What am I selling?

- Am I selling a finished “system”? >> then I have to build it first
- Am I selling the AI strategy? Then implementation is separate?
- Am I selling the growth advising? And the AI is secondary?
- Am I selling the individual agents?
- Am I selling the agency “do it for you” service model?
