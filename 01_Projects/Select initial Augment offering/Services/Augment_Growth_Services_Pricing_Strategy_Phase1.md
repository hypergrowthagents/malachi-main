## Strategic Recommendations

**Rationale**:
- Single client achieves $10K+ revenue requirement
- Comprehensive solution creates higher switching costs
- Premium positioning reinforces "Anti-AI Company" value proposition
- Easier to deliver integrated solution than coordinate separate modules

### Performance Component Strategy

**Recommendation**: Include performance components on Attribution Intelligence Engine only

**Rationale**:
- Creates alignment without operational complexity
- Self-funding model reduces price sensitivity
- Demonstrates confidence in results
- Avoid performance components on operational services (reporting, creative)

### Client Acquisition Strategy

**Target Profile for First 3 Clients:**
- $75K+ monthly ad spend (justifies full bundle pricing)
- Series A companies with investor reporting requirements
- Existing analytics/attribution pain points
- Internal marketing team of 3-5 people (sophisticated enough to appreciate value)

### Risk Mitigation

**30-Day Performance Guarantee**: Offer full refund if Attribution Intelligence Engine doesn't identify minimum 10% budget optimization opportunity

**Gradual Implementation**: Start with one module, expand based on results (despite bundle preference)

**Documentation Focus**: Over-document all processes for automation and team scaling
