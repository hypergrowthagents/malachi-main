# AI-Powered Growth Leadership for Consumer Subscription Apps

**What if you could run growth like a Series B companyâ€”without the $500K+ team?**

---

## Where You Are Now

Your product has traction. You're spending $50K-200K/month on ads. But you're stuck in **growth bottleneck hell:**

**The Vendor Coordination Tax**
- Creative agency + media buyer + analyst = 3-5 different resources operating in silos
- Coordination becomes its own full-time job
- Combined cost: $15-30K/month with **slower execution** than an in-house team

**The Speed Problem**
- Agencies are delivering on 2-week cycles
- You need to operate at daily iteration and learning speed
- Weekly check-ins when you need daily optimization

**The AI Gap**
- You know AI should make growth faster and cheaper, but don't know HOW
- Tried ChatGPTâ€”outputs are generic and mediocre
- Team has limited bandwidth to learn AI while executing daily operations

**The Growth Team Vacuum**
- Managing growth strategy part-time as CEO/COO while fundraising
- Can't afford $500K for 5-person team (Head of Growth, Performance Marketer, Analyst, Creative Director, Producer)
- Hiring takes 6-12 months you don't have

**Meanwhile:** You're approaching Series A in 12-18 months and need to prove channel diversification and unit economics.

## How We Bridge the Gap

**This isn't fractional CMO work** (strategy without execution).
**This isn't agency work** (execution in a black box).
**This isn't DIY** (your expensive time on campaigns).

**This is AI-augmented growth leadership**â€”delivering what normally requires 5 people through strategic focus and AI leverage.

### Strategic Leadership

- **20+ creative concepts/month** with systematic testing

### Knowledge Transfer (The Real Differentiator)
Unlike agencies that keep their "secret sauce" proprietary, **I teach your team the exact AI system I use to deliver results.**

**What changes for your team:**
- Campaign optimization: 2 hours â†’ 15 minutes
- Competitive analysis: 4 hours â†’ 20 minutes
- SOP creation: 1.5 hours â†’ 10 minutes

**You get:**
- Claude Code setup customized for your growth operations

**The outcome:** Your team becomes permanently better at AI-driven growth, not dependent on a vendor.

## Investment

**Module 1 - Growth Leader:** $10K/month
*(Strategic leadership + AI capability building)*

**Module 2 - Paid Acquisition + Creative + Analytics:** 10% of monthly ad spend
*(Full execution, minimum $5K/month)*

**Recommended: Both modules combined**
- Example: $75K monthly ad spend = $10K + $7.5K = **$17.5K/month total**

**Compare to alternatives:**
- Full growth team: $500K+/year + 9-12 month hiring timeline
- Agency silos: $15-30K/month with coordination overhead
- Fractional CMO: Strategy only, no execution, no AI capability transfer

**Engagement:** Month-to-month, full velocity by Week 4

## What Makes This Different

**Agencies:** Keep processes proprietary â†’ operate in black boxes â†’ monthly summary reports

**This:** Share everything â†’ operator-grade transparency â†’ you keep all playbooks/SOPs/workflows forever
