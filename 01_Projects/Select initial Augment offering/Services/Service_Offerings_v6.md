# Service Offerings v6.0 - AI-Native Growth Operations
**Status:** #in-progress
**Date:** 2025-10-08

## The Positioning

I'm a growth leader who runs your growth operation and upgrades it to AI-native in the process.

Instead of hiring 5 roles (Head of Growth, Performance Marketing Manager, Analyst, Creative Director, Producer) at $500K+ annually, you get all those capabilities through me - augmented by AI processes that deliver 10x execution speed.

I don't just execute growth strategies. I design workflows and implement AI-native operations: tool stacks, SOPs, and processes that make your team permanently faster. I've give you the AI methods that I've tested, built, and refined over time, so you can speed up the learning curve. You get results now + the playbook to sustain them after I'm gone.

**Built for:** Early-stage Consumer AI, Fintech, and subscription apps ready to operate at AI speed.

## The Problem You're Solving

**Growth Team Gap:**
- Can't afford $360K+ for 5-person growth team (Head of Growth, Performance Marketer, Analyst, Creative Director, Producer)
- Hiring takes 9-12 months (3-6 months recruiting + 3-6 months ramp)
- No time to properly manage a growth team and oversee growth strategy
- Need results NOW for upcoming fundraise or growth targets

**AI Implementation Gap:**
- Companies know that they need to get sophisticated with leveraging AI in order to survive or establish competitive advantage. 
- Everyone knows AI should make growth faster/more scalable, but no one knows HOW to implement it or where to start
- Tools exist (Claude, n8n, MidJourney) but no playbook for using them systematically to solve growth problems
- The average quality of AI outputs tends to be generic and mediocre (aka. AI work slop)
- Internal team doesn't have time to learn AI workflows while executing daily operations
- People can't keep up with the pace of AI change. It feels like a full-time job on its own to monitor and test new capabilities, let alone implement them

**Execution Speed Gap:**
- Traditional agencies move in 2-week cycles (you need daily iteration)
- Fractional CMOs provide strategy but don't execute (you need both)
- DIY means founder time on campaigns (expensive opportunity cost)

**Capabilities Gap:**
- Startup employees move fast, have to wear lots of hats, and need to be scrappy and resourceful with what they have
- Agencies and specialists deliver fairly narrow, tailored solutions that aren't very robust or flexible
- Bloated agency model is designed for risk avoidance; requires a multitude of people across specializations that dramatically slows down deliverables
- Modern AI-native (or aspiring) startups want people who can come in and figure out innovative solutions with AI to do what previously would have been impossible or very expensive

### Module 2: Paid Acquisition + Creative + Analytics
"Done FOR you"
**10% of monthly media spend (minimum $5,000/month)**

**What You Get:**
- **Campaign Management** (daily)
  - Platform monitoring and optimization (Meta, Google, TikTok)
  - Budget allocation and bid strategy management
  - Performance threshold tracking with auto-pause recommendations
  - Creative testing roadmap and systematic experimentation

- **Creative Strategy & Production** (weekly)
  - Ad copy generation (10-20 variants per week vs. 2-3 manual)
  - Video script concepts (UGC, direct response formats)
  - Creative performance analysis (what's working and WHY)
  - Competitive creative intelligence and trend identification
  - AI-assisted creative production++

- **Analytics & Insights** (ongoing)
  - Weekly performance intelligence with actionable next steps
  - Cross-campaign ROAS analysis
  - Anomaly detection with explanations (not just "CAC went up")
  - Attribution analysis and channel interaction effects+++

  - Custom pattern library for YOUR brand (experiment learnings you own)

**Who This Is For:**
- Startups with $50K+ monthly ad spend who need full execution
- Companies without internal performance marketing capability
- Operators who want daily optimization without managing it themselves
- Performance teams who want help unlocking new channels

+++ Available once monthly spend is over $100k or for a $5k one-time add-on
++ Creative production add on starting at $3,500/mo for 10 video concepts + 10 static concepts

---

### Recommended Combination: Both Modules
**Total: $10K + 10% of spend**

Example pricing:
- $50K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $5K Execution = **$15K/month total**
- $75K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $7.5K Execution = **$17.5K/month total**
- $100K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $10K Execution = **$20K/month total**

**vs. Hiring:**
- Head of Growth: $200K
- Performance Marketer: $150K
- Analyst: $120K
- Creative Director: $110K
- Producer: $70K
- **Total: $650K annual vs. $180K-240K with AugmentGrowth**

Note: Salaries would be 1.5x this level fully loaded with benefits, taxes, etc.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I just hire Module 2 (execution) without Module 1 (strategy)?**

A: Yes, though I strongly recommend both. If you have strong internal strategic leadership and just need execution horsepower, Module 2 can work standalone. Minimum $5K/month (10% of $50K spend).

**Q: What happens if my ad spend fluctuates?**

A: Module 2 pricing flexes with spend (10% of actual monthly spend). If you scale from $50K to $100K, execution fee goes from $5K to $10K. If you scale down, fee decreases proportionally.

**Q: Do I need to pay for AI tools separately?**

A: You pay for subscriptions you use directly (your own Claude Pro, MidJourney, etc.). I pay for tools I use in delivery (AI subscriptions, analysis tools, etc.). I provide the playbooks and SOPs to use these tools effectively - that's the real value. Any custom needs that require specialized tools will be discussed and approved by client if costs are passed on.

**Q: What if I already have a performance marketer on staff?**

A: Perfect - hire me for Module 1 (Growth Leader) to provide strategic direction, AI implementation, and work with your internal marketer. I'll level them up with AI workflows while ensuring strategic alignment.

**Q: How is this different from an agency?**

A: Three key differences:
1. **AI-native operations**: I teach you how to implement AI processes into your team (you keep the playbook)
2. **Strategic + execution**: Agencies are either strategic advisors OR executors, not both
3. **Operator-grade transparency**: Real-time access to everything, not black box reporting

**Q: What happens to the AI workflows and playbooks if we part ways?**

A: **You keep everything.** Pattern library, SOPs, workflow documentation, tool recommendations - it's all yours. The goal is to make you permanently better at AI-driven growth.

## Malachi's Additions - 10/9

**AI Services**

Here are some things that I can help augment on the AI services side that we should build into the services language in addition to what we've already discussed above. This should add value and make it more clear (I hope):

1. Work OS: I will teach clients how to build and organize an internal knowledge system designed to give AI systems deep context of the company, function, projects, and resources. Similar workshops sell for $10k per person.
	1. Master Prompt - implement a unified prompt in Claude that fine tunes it to the context of the business and individual
	2. PARA structure (Team/Org) - implement a structure for knowledge retrieval that groups information by actionability
	3. Context update system - syncing meeting notes and project files to new file structure; monthly/quarterly refresh of project goals and master prompt
2. Personal OS: I will teach stakeholders how to use Claude Code (the SOTA agent) to run their work life as their primary interface. This is **completely optional**, and highly recommended. I will give you the foundations and education to implement the following:
	1. PARA structure (Individual) - set up an Obsidian, Google, or Notion drive as their primary vault for note taking
	2. Cursor and/or Warp - as the visual interface for using Claude Code
	3. MCPs - to access external tools/integrations
	4. Github - for file backups, task tracking, and remote actions
	5. Sub-agents - to run specialized, parallel processes
	6. And much more...
3. I will teach the team how to leverage projects for shared context and mini-automation
4. I will share the preferred tools/AI stack I use for growth and productivity
5. I will share a prompt library of useful prompts to accomplish growth tasks
6. I will provide SOPs for how I accomplish specific workflows with AI (e.g. how to make an AI UGC video)
7. I will help the internal teams brainstorm hackathon/MVP projects that they can show off to execs that are designed to drive growth
