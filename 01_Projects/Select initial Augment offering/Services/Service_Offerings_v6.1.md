## Why Companies Hire Me

### **If You're a CEO/COO (Strategic Leadership Vacuum)**

**You're experiencing:**
- No one owning growth strategy end-to-end (you're wearing the growth hat part-time)
- Lack experience building sophisticated, systematic growth operations
- Approaching fundraise and board asking "what's the growth plan?"
- See competitors moving faster with AI but don't know where to start

**What you want:**
- **Strategic Leadership:** Someone to own growth roadmap, prioritize initiatives, manage execution
- **AI-First Approach:** Implement AI-native growth processes from the start, not retrofit later
- **Speed to Results:** Can't wait 9-12 months to hire and ramp a team
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Team learns AI capabilities, doesn't stay dependent on vendor

---

### **If You're a Growth Leader (Channel/Execution Needs)**

**You're experiencing:**
- Team maxed out - can't scale current channels AND prove out new ones
- Managing 3-5 agencies/freelancers = coordination nightmare and slow execution
- CAC creeping up, need 15-30% efficiency improvement for unit economics
- Want to leverage AI but team doesn't have bandwidth to learn while executing

**What you want:**
- **Prove New Channels:** De-risk TikTok, YouTube, podcasts without pulling team off current work
- **Scale Existing Channels:** Creative refresh, audience expansion, operational support to 2-3x spend
- **Improve Efficiency:** Systematic experimentation, creative testing, AI-powered optimization
- **Consolidate Vendors:** One integrated partner for strategy + execution + analysis vs. managing silos

---

## The Problems I Solve

### **Growth Team Gap**
- Can't afford $500K+ for 5-person team (Head of Growth, Performance Marketer, Analyst, Creative Director, Producer)
- Hiring takes 9-12 months (3-6 recruiting + 3-6 ramp) - don't have that time
- Internal team at capacity - can't add new channels or scale existing
- Managing growth strategy part-time as CEO/COO = bottleneck

### **AI Implementation Gap**
- Know AI should make growth faster/cheaper but don't know HOW to implement
- Tools exist (Claude, GoMarble, MidJourney) but no playbook for systematic use in growth
- Tried AI tools but outputs are generic and mediocre ("AI slop")
- Can't keep up with pace of AI change - feels like full-time job to monitor new capabilities
- Team doesn't have time to learn AI workflows while executing daily operations

### **Execution Speed Gap**
- Traditional agencies move in 2-week cycles (need daily iteration)
- Fractional CMOs provide strategy but don't execute (need both)
- DIY means founder time on campaigns (expensive opportunity cost)
- Current execution partners operate in black boxes (want transparency)

### **Vendor Coordination Hell**
- Working with creative agency + media buyer + analyst = 3-5 different vendors
- Each operates in silo, no integration or shared context
- Coordination overhead becomes its own full-time job
- Combined cost $15-30K/month with slower execution than in-house team would deliver

## The Solution: AI-Native Growth Leadership

### **What I Do**

I run your growth operations using AI-native workflows - which means I deliver what normally requires 5 people through AI leverage and strategic execution.

**Strategic Leadership:**
- Own your growth roadmap, channel strategy, and prioritization
- Coordinate internal resources, external partners, and execution
- Drive systematic experimentation and learning (not ad hoc testing)

**Hands-On Execution:**
- Use AI agents and workflows to execute 3x faster than traditional methods
- Campaign launches in 48 hours (vs. 2-week agency cycles)
- Creative production: 20 variants/week (vs. 3 manual)
- Daily optimization and analysis (vs. weekly check-ins)

**AI Capability Transfer:**
- Share the playbooks, prompts, and processes I use to deliver results
- Teach your team to leverage same AI tools for permanent speed advantage
- Build AI-native operations into your company (not dependency on me)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I have a performance marketer on staff - can you still help?**

A: Absolutely. Hire me for Module 1 (Growth Leader) to provide strategic direction, AI enablement, and support your internal marketer. I'll level them up with AI workflows, manage the strategic roadmap, and ensure execution alignment. Your team becomes permanently more capable.

**Q: Can I just hire Module 2 (execution) without Module 1 (strategy)?**

A: Yes, if you have strong internal strategic leadership and need execution horsepower. Module 2 works standalone with $5K minimum (10% of $50K spend). However, I strongly recommend both modules for integrated strategy + execution.

**Q: What happens if my ad spend fluctuates month-to-month?**

A: Module 2 pricing flexes with actual monthly spend (10% of spend). Scale from $50K to $100K = fee goes from $5K to $10K. Scale down = fee decreases proportionally. Module 1 stays flat at $10K/month.

**Q: Do I need to pay for AI tools separately?**

A: You pay for subscriptions your team uses directly (Claude Pro, MidJourney, etc.). I pay for tools I use in delivery (analysis tools, data subscriptions, specialized AI services). I provide playbooks and SOPs to use these tools effectively - that's the real value. Any specialized tool costs for your specific needs will be discussed and approved before incurring.

**Q: What's included in "AI capability transfer" - are you building automations for us?**

A: No, I'm NOT building custom automations in your tech stack (that's AI automation consulting - different service).

What I DO:
- Use AI to deliver growth results faster (my execution method)
- Share playbooks, prompts, and processes I use
- Teach your team to leverage same AI tools
- Document workflows so you can replicate them
- Train team through live sessions and SOPs

What I DON'T do:
- Build Zapier/Make/n8n workflows in your systems
- Set up enterprise AI infrastructure
- Integrate AI tools with your tech stack
- Custom AI model development

**Q: How is this different from an agency?**

A: Three key differences:

1. **AI-native operations:** I teach you AI processes (you keep capability forever) vs. agency black box
2. **Strategic + execution integration:** Agencies are either strategic advisors OR executors, rarely both
3. **Operator-grade transparency:** Real-time access to everything, closed-loop documentation vs. monthly summary reports

**Q: What happens to the AI workflows and playbooks if we part ways?**

A: **You keep everything.** Pattern library, SOPs, workflow documentation, tool recommendations, prompt libraries - it's all yours. The goal is to make your team permanently better at AI-driven growth, not create dependency on me.

**Q: How do you deliver what requires 5 people?**

A: AI leverage + strategic focus. I use AI agents for:
- 24/7 campaign monitoring (replaces analyst bandwidth)
- Creative generation at scale (10-20 variants vs. 2-3 manual)
- Competitive research and insights (automated vs. manual research)
- Performance analysis and reporting (real-time vs. weekly dashboards)

I handle strategic decisions, creative direction, and quality control. Fractional support assists with execution tasks. Combined = output of 5-person team at fraction of cost.
