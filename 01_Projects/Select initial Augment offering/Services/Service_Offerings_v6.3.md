## Who This Is For

### **Consumer Subscription App Startups**

Seed to Series A stage companies ($3-8M raised) managing $50K-200K monthly ad spend across:
- **Consumer AI/SaaS:** Productivity tools, creator tools, AI assistants
- **Consumer Fintech:** Personal finance apps, budgeting tools
- **Productivity apps:** Project management, collaboration, note-taking

**What makes you a fit:**
- Subscription-based revenue model (web or mobile app)
- Product-market fit achieved, scaling customer acquisition
- $3M-8M ARR, approaching Series A in 12-18 months
- Need systematic growth operations + AI-powered execution

---

## Why Companies Hire Me

### **If You're a CEO/COO

**What you want:**
- **Strategic Leadership:** Someone to own growth roadmap, prioritize initiatives, manage execution
- **AI-First Approach:** Build AI-powered workflows from the start, not retrofit later
- **Speed to Results:** Can't wait 9-12 months to hire and ramp a team
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Team learns AI capabilities, doesn't stay dependent on vendor

---

### **If You're a Growth Leader

**What you want:**
- **Scale Existing Channels:** Creative refresh, audience expansion, operational support to 2-3x spend
- **Prove New Channels:** De-risk new paid channels without pulling team off current work
- **Improve Efficiency:** Systematic experimentation, creative testing, AI-powered optimization
- **Consolidate Vendors:** One integrated partner for strategy + execution + analysis vs. managing silos

---

## The Problems I Solve

### **Growth Team Gap**
- Can't afford $500K+ for 5-person team (Head of Growth, Performance Marketer, Analyst, Creative Director, Producer)
- Hiring takes 9-12 months (3-6 recruiting + 3-6 ramp) - don't have that time
- Internal team at capacity - can't add new channels or scale existing
- Managing growth strategy part-time as CEO/COO = bottleneck

### **AI Implementation Gap**
- Know AI should make growth faster/cheaper but don't know HOW to implement
- Tools exist (ChatGPT, Claude, n8n) but no playbook for systematic use in growth
- Tried AI tools but outputs are generic and mediocre ("AI slop")
- Can't keep up with pace of AI change - feels like full-time job to monitor new capabilities
- Team doesn't have time to learn AI workflows while executing daily operations

### **Execution Speed Gap**
- Traditional agencies move in 2-week cycles (need daily iteration)
- Fractional CMOs provide strategy but don't execute (need both)
- DIY means founder time on campaigns (expensive opportunity cost)
- Current execution partners operate in black boxes (want transparency)

### **Vendor Coordination Hell**
- Working with creative agency + media buyer + analyst = 3-5 different vendors
- Each operates in silo, no integration or shared context
- Coordination overhead becomes its own full-time job
- Combined cost $15-30K/month with slower execution than in-house team would deliver

## The Solution: AI-Powered Growth Leadership

### **What I Do**

I run your growth operations augmented by AI-powered workflows - which means I deliver what normally requires 5 people through AI leverage and strategic execution.

**Strategic Leadership:**
- Own your growth roadmap, channel strategy, and prioritization
- Coordinate internal resources, external partners, and execution
- Drive systematic experimentation and learning (not ad hoc testing)

**Hands-On Execution:**
- Use AI agents and workflows to execute faster than traditional methods
- Creative production: 20+ new concepts per month with systematic testing framework
- Campaign launches in 48 hours (vs. 2-week agency cycles)
- Daily optimization and analysis (vs. weekly check-ins)

**AI Capability Transfer:**
- Share the playbooks, prompts, and processes I use to deliver results
- Teach your team to leverage same AI tools for permanent speed advantage
- Build AI-powered operations into your company (not dependency on me)

---

## Service Modules

### **Module 1: Growth Leader**
**"Done WITH You" - $10,000/month**

Strategic growth leadership + AI capability building

**Strategic Leadership (Ongoing)**
- Audit + 6-month growth roadmap (first 30 days)
  - Measurement framework: KPIs, benchmarks, and success criteria
  - Channel dependency assessment and diversification roadmap
  - Systematic testing framework to prove new channels without wasting budget
  - Short/medium/long-term prioritization
  - Needs assessment (what you have vs. what you need)
  - North Star KPI alignment

- Monthly strategic review meeting
- Bi-weekly KPI analysis and exec updates
- Work with internal stakeholders to coordinate delivery
- Support/manage external partners or internal resources

**AI Capability Transfer** *(What makes this different from agencies)*

Unlike agencies that keep their "secret sauce" proprietary, I teach your team the exact AI system I use to deliver results.

**The Tool: Claude Code (Not Just for Engineers)**

Most growth marketers think Claude Code is a coding tool. It's not. It's a state-of-the-art general purpose agent that can actually take action on your computer. It's your personal assistant, your engineer, your analyst, and much more.

**What Changes:**
- Campaign optimization: 2 hours → 15 minutes
- Competitive analysis: 4 hours → 20 minutes
- SOP creation: 1.5 hours → 10 minutes

**Why It's Different Than ChatGPT:**
- ChatGPT = copy/paste text back and forth
- Claude Code = writes files, updates calendars, builds workflows, integrates with your tools

**The "Aha Moments":**
- Personal chief of staff managing your daily priorities
- Strategic debates with 3 AI agents giving you consensus recommendations
- It can build custom automations for you (no coding required)

**What You Get:**
- Claude Code setup customized for your growth operations
- Needs assessment with 3-5 starter workflows for your specific challenges
- Working prompts for growth tasks (SME agent profiles, analysis, briefs, reporting, research)
- Live training: Watch me work with Claude Code, then practice on your problems
- Advising on AI tech stack choices
- Documentation to replicate and expand on your own

**The Reality:**
This is early-stage technology that evolves constantly. I'm teaching you the system I use daily, and constantly refining. You'll start with 3-5 core workflows and expand from there.

**My Value:**
Most marketers see Claude Code as "too technical" and intimidating. I shepherd non-technical teams into using it confidently - making it approachable with specific starting points and hands-on training.

**Outcome:**
Your team gets a personal AI assistant that takes action (not just answers questions). Capability stays when engagement ends.

**Time Investment:**
- 2-3 hours per person setup
- 3 team training sessions
- Ongoing documentation as I work

**Who This Is For:**
- CEO/COO with strategic leadership vacuum in growth
- Growth leaders who want seasoned advisor alongside execution support
- Operators who want to build AI-powered growth capabilities with expert guidance

---

**Analytics & Insights (Ongoing)**
- Weekly performance intelligence with actionable next steps
- Cross-channel performance reporting (unified view across Meta, Google, TikTok)
- Cross-campaign ROAS analysis and pattern discovery
- Anomaly detection with explanations (not just "CAC went up")

*Advanced attribution capabilities (multi-touch attribution, incrementality testing, LTV modeling) available for established clients with 90+ days of performance data. Discuss during strategic reviews.*

**Who This Is For:**
- Startups with $50K+ monthly ad spend who need full execution
- Companies without internal performance marketing capability
- Performance teams who want help scaling new channels
- Growth leaders who need operational leverage to do more with less

---

### **Recommended: Both Modules Combined**
**Total Investment: $10K + 10% of spend**

**Example Pricing:**
- $50K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $5K Execution = **$15K/month**
- $75K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $7.5K Execution = **$17.5K/month**
- $100K monthly ad spend = $10K Growth Leader + $10K Execution = **$20K/month**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I have a performance marketer on staff - can you still help?**

A: Absolutely. Hire me for Module 1 (Growth Leader) to provide strategic direction, AI enablement, and support your internal marketer. I'll level them up with AI workflows, manage the strategic roadmap, and ensure execution alignment. Your team becomes permanently more capable.

**Q: Can I just hire Module 2 (execution) without Module 1 (strategy)?**

A: Yes, if you have strong internal strategic leadership and need execution horsepower. Module 2 works standalone with $5K minimum (10% of $50K spend). However, I strongly recommend both modules for integrated strategy + execution.

**Q: What happens if my ad spend fluctuates month-to-month?**

A: Module 2 pricing flexes with actual monthly spend (10% of spend). Scale from $50K to $100K = fee goes from $5K to $10K. Scale down = fee decreases proportionally. Module 1 stays flat at $10K/month.

**Q: Do I need to pay for AI tools separately?**

A: You pay for subscriptions your team uses directly (Claude Team, etc.). I pay for tools I use in delivery (analysis tools, data subscriptions, specialized AI services). I provide playbooks and SOPs to use these tools effectively - that's the real value. Any specialized tool costs for your specific needs will be discussed and approved before incurring.

**Q: What's included in "AI capability transfer" - are you building automations for us?**

A: No, I'm NOT building custom automations in your tech stack (that's AI automation consulting - different service).

What I DO:
- Use AI to deliver growth results faster (my execution method)
- Share playbooks, prompts, and processes I use
- Teach your team to leverage same AI tools
- Document workflows so you can replicate them
- Train team through live sessions and SOPs

What I DON'T do:
- Build Zapier/Make/n8n workflows in your systems
- Set up enterprise AI infrastructure
- Integrate AI tools with your tech stack
- Custom AI model development

**Q: How is this different from an agency?**

A: Three key differences:

1. **AI capability transfer:** I teach you AI processes (you keep capability forever) vs. agency black box
2. **Strategic + execution integration:** Agencies are either strategic advisors OR executors, rarely both
3. **Operator-grade transparency:** Real-time access to everything, closed-loop documentation vs. monthly summary reports

**Q: What happens to the AI workflows and playbooks if we part ways?**

A: **You keep everything.** Experimentation library, SOPs, workflow documentation, tool recommendations, prompt libraries - it's all yours. The goal is to make your team permanently better at AI-driven growth, not create dependency on me.

**Q: How do you deliver what requires 5 people?**

A: AI leverage + strategic focus. I use AI agents for:
- 24/7 campaign monitoring (replaces analyst bandwidth)
- Creative generation at scale (20+ concepts/month vs. 2-3 manual)
- Competitive research and insights (automated vs. manual research)
- Performance analysis and reporting (real-time vs. weekly dashboards)

I handle strategic decisions, creative direction, and quality control. Fractional support assists with execution tasks. Combined = output of 5-person team at fraction of cost.
