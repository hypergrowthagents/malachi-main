## 1. Initial ICP Discovery - Responses from Malachi Rose

### Company Profile Rationale
**Focus**: Performance marketing expertise where my domain knowledge is strongest
**Logic**: Find companies ready to scale performance marketing but not so big their demands exceed delivery capability
**Alternative to**: Hiring 5-6 specialists � one marketing generalist running AI-enhanced system

#### Company Size & Scale Indicators:
- **Not stuck on specific metrics** (15-100 people, Series A, $100k+/mo ad spend)
- **Core principle**: Companies that value performance marketing at scale where investment is justified
- **Scale threshold**: High enough that 10-20k/month service investment makes sense vs. their ad spend
- **Capability gap**: Want to scale without massive headcount expansion

### Service Delivery Model - UNRESOLVED STRATEGIC QUESTION
**Two potential paths to explore:**

1. **Enable Model**: Implement AI capabilities they can run themselves
2. **Done-For-You Model**: Own and run the total process end-to-end

*Note: Need to map service lines for both approaches and determine which better fits pain points, revenue opportunity, and fulfillment capacity*

### Current AI Capability Assessment
**Target Profile**: Companies that use basic AI (ChatGPT, Claude) but haven't built sophisticated internal efficiency/scaling systems
**Gap**: Know AI exists but lack time/capability to build agentic systems
**Assumption**: Open to AI-first capabilities without legacy systems to unwind

### Market Segments by Pain Point Intensity

#### Segment 1: AI-First Startups
- **Profile**: Early-stage wanting full AI-enhanced GTM from start
- **Pain**: Need initial infrastructure setup
- **Opportunity**: Ground-floor implementation

#### Segment 2: Scaling Performance Marketing
- **Profile**: Have structural foundations, need AI amplification
- **Pain**: Scaling existing engine efficiently
- **Opportunity**: Enhancement of proven systems

#### Segment 3: Efficiency/Headcount Optimization
- **Profile**: At scale, recently reduced headcount or need to do more with less
- **Pain**: Maintaining output with fewer resources
- **Challenge**: May prefer specialist solutions or established agencies
- **Note**: Likely need to build credibility before accessing this segment

### Decision Maker Profile
**Primary**: CMO/CEO/Head of Growth/VP of Marketing
**Mindset**: AI-first, responsible for driving growth
**Internal Consideration**: Position as complement to existing team (not replacement) to avoid resistance from implementers

### Trigger Events for Buying Decision
1. **Scaling pressure**: Plans to significantly increase performance marketing spend
2. **Headcount crossroads**: Need to scale but deciding between hiring vs. external solutions
3. **Resource constraints**: Pressure to do more with fewer resources

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

#### Primary Competition: SaaS Tool Aggregation
- **Reality**: Specialized SaaS tools for specific problems (UGC video, etc.)
- **Buyer behavior**: Likely evaluating cobbling together multiple tools
- **Differentiation opportunity**: Running tools + optimizing outputs vs. just providing access
- **Value prop**: "ChatGPT subscription doesn't run itself" - need expertise to extract value

#### Secondary Competition:
2. **Internal development**: Building proprietary solutions in-house
3. **AI-specialized agencies**: Established players with broader capabilities
4. **Specialist hiring**: Finding AI-native talent internally

### Success Metrics Priority
**Primary**: **Cost comparison** - Can we do it better for less than alternatives?
**Secondary benefits**: Time savings, revenue impact, competitive advantage
**Rationale**: Cost is most quantifiable and comparable; revenue impact creates skepticism
