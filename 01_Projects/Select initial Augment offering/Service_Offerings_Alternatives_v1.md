# Potential Offering: AI Transformation

## My Idea:
I've been thinking through the potential of maybe I should actually have some sort of AI transformation offering. My head goes based on trying to build out something for augment growth where I have essentially solved customer acquisition. What if I had a version that was something that companies could plug into their own internal environments and their teams could run? That way it would solve the pain point of companies knowing that they need to transform their business processes with AI, but just not knowing even where to get started. 

The solution I have in mind is that I could collect all of the different elements of how to implement AI in a modern growth stack, growth marketing stack, that would help speed up their time to get these pieces implemented by many, many months. So I could give them a variety of workflows, tell them which models to use, give them the JSON prompts for N8N, give them the playbooks that I've written out of exactly how to do specific processes like generating AI, EGC video, how to do analytics with AI, and so on. 

The key piece is that I would not be responsible for the implementation. Every business is too unique. And I think I would run into some hurdles trying to implement this in a way that would work for everyone's stack. And so they would need to bring their own resources or I could partner with implementers to solve that side of it. But I do think that this is just going to be a really large market of companies who need this help. Danielle's feedback for me was maybe this is just a bit too narrow and potentially a bit too downstreet. I'm trying to target companies who just are looking for a plug-and-play stack. And in fact, that there might be an opportunity here to help companies think through this transformation a little bit further upstream. 

So maybe the final result is a blend of these two things of a part A and part B, where I help them assess and identify their highest value opportunities. And then I offer to sell them ready-to-roll solutions for anything that they want to take from me, or they can go off and run it themselves otherwise. But I position myself as extremely knowledgeable in all things AI and growth and know exactly what tools and processes and capabilities to implement and just help these poor lost souls navigate it and get to a place where they're leveraging AI very competently within their own departments.

## Danielle's Idea:
I could be an AI transformation facilitator that goes into help companies think about what the highest priority AI automation workflows are. Run brainstorms and hackathons and help them go through the analysis exercise. The end output of doing these workshops and analysis with them is that the exec team would have a list of at least five ideas that their team and myself have brainstormed as the highest potential things to work on, including:

- the level of investment required
- the timeline
- the cost
- ideally even prototypes that their internal teams have worked on

Developing like a light MVP just to prove out the viability of it. The downside I see of doing this is that I don't really want to just be a pure facilitator where I'm just running workshops and flying all over the country to do public speaking in front of large teams. I think there's an interesting idea there which is to help companies a bit further upstream that aren't ready to jump in and immediately adopt my approach but rather need to spend a little bit of time going through an assessment phase and figuring out what they need and what they want to prioritize. And so there's probably some elements I can extract out of this AI capability assessment where maybe I can do a lighter version and help them run their own hackathons and feed me the info. And then that would be like step one. And step two would be that I would have a whole modular AI kit that they could essentially buy components of that they want to take and run with. It could be some of the AI workflows that I've built for Augment and the processes and the stack and the prompts and everything that just helps dramatically accelerate their time to adopt AI and gives them a guide and a playbook to work with. 

I think Danielle's point is like don't skip the work upstream of it. For a lot of companies, take them on the journey from assessment through deployment.

# Claude Feedback:

All four business-partner perspectives are unanimous: **The Current Model (AI-Augmented Customer Acquisition) is the clear winner.**

## Summary of Findings

### Market Attractiveness

- **Winner: Current Model (10x more attractive)**
- Clear TAM (200-300 companies), perfect timing (2025 CAC crisis), urgent pain point (survival-level)
- Alternative is crowded (competing with McKinsey), non-urgent ("nice to have"), unclear buyer

### Positioning & Competitive Advantage

- **Winner: Current Model (plays to authentic strengths)**
- You're credible as operator who built AI systems (proven)
- Not credible as transformation consultant (zero experience in facilitation/workshops)
- Alternative requires building entirely new capabilities vs. scaling existing expertise

### Scalability & Operational Efficiency

- **Winner: Current Model (operationally smarter)**
- ONE business with 70% repeatable delivery, AI agents provide leverage
- Alternative is 4-5 different businesses (workshops + consulting + kits + implementation)
- Current model: clear path to $500K with 4-5 clients, Alternative: constant context-switching

### Strategic Risk & Validation

- **Winner: Current Model (validated vs. speculation)**
- Current: Customer discovery done, positive signals, systems built, 30-60 days to revenue
- Alternative: Zero validation, 4-6 months before first test, requires building everything first
- Classic founder self-sabotage: "exploring options" to avoid uncomfortable sales work

## Direct Answer to Your Questions

**Is the alternative more/less/equally attractive?** **LESS attractive** on every dimension - market size, urgency, competition, scalability, validation, risk.

 

**Are you well-positioned to do it?** **No.** You're positioned to EXECUTE growth marketing with AI systems. You're not positioned to CONSULT on transformation or FACILITATE workshops. That requires different skills you don't have.

 

**Are you spreading yourself too thin?** **The alternative WOULD spread you thin.** It's literally 4-5 different businesses: facilitation, consulting, productization, implementation. The current model is ONE business with AI leverage.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

You're experiencing classic founder pattern-matching: questioning the validated path because you're afraid to sell. The alternative model feels safer because it delays the scary part (making sales calls, hearing "no", proving results).

 

**Your wife's concern is valid but timing is wrong.** The "upstream assessment work" makes sense as an UPSELL after you've proven value with execution. Not as your entry point.

## My Recommendation

**Execute Current Model for 90 days. No alternatives, no pivots, no "keeping options open."**

 

Set concrete milestones:

- 3 paying customers by January 6, 2025
- 5 qualified sales conversations per week
- Track close rate and objections

If you get to March with 0 traction, THEN consider pivoting. But you won't know if this works until you actually try to sell it.

 

**Stop exploring. Start executing.** You have a 70% validated opportunity. Don't trade it for 5% speculation.
