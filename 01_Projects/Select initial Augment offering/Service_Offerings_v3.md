## How It Works

### **Phase 1: The Guarantee (60 Days)**

**We target 15% CAC improvement in 60 days using systematic optimization:**

1. **Audit & Baseline** (Days 1-7)
   - Deep campaign audit across platforms (Meta, TikTok, Google)
   - Establish baseline CAC and performance metrics
   - Deploy AI agents: ICP Research, Campaign Health Monitor, Budget Optimizer

2. **Optimize & Test** (Days 8-50)
   - Daily campaign health monitoring and optimization
   - Weekly creative concepts and copy variants
   - Bi-weekly audience expansion testing
   - Real-time budget allocation for CAC targets

3. **Results Validation** (Days 51-60)
   - Measure CAC improvement vs. baseline
   - Client decides: Continue at full rate OR request refund if unsatisfied

**Pricing:** 10% of monthly media spend (example: $50K spend = $5K/month)

**Guarantee Structure:**

| CAC Improvement | Client Can Request | You Keep |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **15%+** | No refund eligible | 100% of fees |
| **10-14%** | 25% refund | 75% of fees |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do you guarantee 15% CAC improvement?**
A: We use systematic optimization across creative, targeting, budget allocation, and campaign structure - combined with proprietary AI agents that identify opportunities faster than manual analysis. We only take clients we're confident we can help (strict qualification criteria).

**Q: What if I'm already optimizing my campaigns heavily?**
A: Most companies optimize reactively (fix what's broken). We optimize systematically (test proactively, identify patterns, compound improvements). Even heavily-optimized campaigns have 15-30% improvement opportunity through creative velocity, audience expansion, and strategic budget allocation.

**Q: Do I have to give you access to my ad accounts?**
A: Yes - we need view access to analyze performance and recommend changes. You retain full control and approve all changes. We can't improve what we can't see.

**Q: What if Meta/TikTok changes their algorithm during the 60 days?**
A: Major platform algorithm changes outside our control are excluded from guarantee (escape clause). Historical platform changes rarely impact CAC by more than 5-10% - our systematic optimization typically overcomes this.

**Q: How much time do I need to invest as a client?**
A: Minimal. 1-hour kickoff call, 30-minute weekly check-ins, async approval of creative/campaign changes (15 minutes per week). We handle the heavy lifting.

**Q: Can you help me launch a new channel (e.g., test TikTok from zero)?**
A: Not under the CAC improvement guarantee (no baseline to improve). We offer a separate "Channel Launch" service ($15-20K fixed fee for 90-day launch). After proving the channel works, we can transition to improvement guarantee model.

**Q: What happens after 60 days if I'm happy with results?**
A: We continue at the same percentage of spend (10% ’ 8% ’ 6% as you scale). We can expand to creative intelligence, analytics, and multi-channel coordination (add-on services at +2-5% of spend).
