## 5. Sales Conversation Framework

### Opening Qualification Questions

**Growth Stage Assessment:**
- "What's your current ARR and growth stage?" (Target: $1M-$50M Series A-C)
- "How are you currently handling growth strategy and execution?"
- "What's working well in your growth efforts, and where are you struggling?"

**Growth Leadership Gap Identification:**
- "Do you have a dedicated growth leader or VP of Growth?"
- "If not, who's currently responsible for growth strategy?"
- "How much growth expertise do you have in-house?"

**Resource Constraint Validation:**
- "Have you considered hiring a VP of Growth? What's holding you back?"
- "What would a senior growth hire cost you all-in?"
- "How long would it take to find and onboard the right person?"

### Value Proposition Delivery

**Problem Acknowledgment:**
"So you need senior growth expertise but can't justify the $300K+ investment or 6-month timeline for a VP of Growth hire. You're stuck between expensive agencies that don't think strategically and AI tools that require you to be the expert."

**Solution Introduction:**
"That's exactly why we built Growth Executive AI. You get executive-level growth thinking and hands-on execution starting at $10K/month - about 90% less than a senior hire with immediate deployment."

**Capability Overview:**
"We combine strategic growth leadership - the kind you'd expect from a VP of Growth - with immediate tactical execution across creative, paid media, and analytics. Think of us as your AI-powered growth executive."

### Objection Handling Framework

**"We're not ready for a growth executive"**
- "That's actually why this works perfectly. You get executive-level growth expertise only when you need it, scaling up as you grow."
- "Most of our clients weren't ready for a full-time VP of Growth either, but they needed the strategic thinking."

**"We already have a growth team"**
- "Perfect. We're designed to augment and lead growth teams, not replace them. Your team gets executive-level strategy and coordination they might not have today."
- "Think of us as the VP of Growth your team reports to."

**"We use agencies/tools already"**
- "How's the strategic thinking? Most agencies execute well but don't provide growth leadership."
- "Tools are great, but who's providing the growth expertise to use them effectively?"

**"$10K/month seems expensive"**
- "Compared to what? A VP of Growth costs $30K/month plus equity and benefits. We're 70% less expensive with immediate deployment."
- "What would one additional month of faster growth be worth to your business?"

### Closing Framework

**Trial Close:**
"If we could deliver VP of Growth-level strategic thinking and execution for 70% less cost and immediate deployment, would that solve your growth leadership challenge?"

**Next Steps:**
"Let's start with a growth strategy session where I can show you exactly how we'd approach your growth challenges. You'll see our strategic thinking in action, and we can map out what growth executive partnership would look like for your business."

**Risk Reversal:**
"You're not committing to a long-term hire or big upfront investment. You're getting access to senior growth expertise you can scale up or down based on what your business needs."
