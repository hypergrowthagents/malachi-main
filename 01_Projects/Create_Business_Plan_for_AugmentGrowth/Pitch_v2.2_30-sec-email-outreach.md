# 30-Second Email Pitch for Augment Growth

**Subject: Testing a new model - looking for feedback**

Hey [Name],

I'm building something new: fractional growth consulting + AI co-building. Instead of "here's my advice" consulting or "buy my AI tool," I partner with early-stage companies to solve their growth challenges while building custom AI systems together—and they keep everything we build.

Think: Daily campaign analysis that spots anomalies. Creative testing that predicts winners. Ad copy generation tuned to your brand. We build these in Claude Code (a programmable AI assistant) while I'm also doing the strategic growth work. No specialists needed to maintain—your team can modify everything in natural language.

I'm looking for 1-2 pilot partners (seed-Series B, $50-200K/month ad spend) and honest feedback from people I trust. I'm trying to learn... What am I missing? Does this solve real pain points?

Attached a full pitch deck with details. Would love 15 minutes to get your take.
