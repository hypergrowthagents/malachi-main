# Augment Growth: Growth Strategy + AI Pilot

## Why I'm Doing This

After 15+ years in growth marketing—scaling Digit from startup to acquisition, running $50M+ budgets at Zynga, building MAVAN from <$100K to seven figures as employee #1—I explored a question: **What if AI could make one growth person as effective as a five-person team—but only if it's built specifically for your business?**

I built POCs. Saw 3-5x output improvements in specific workflows. Worked with AI companies like ElevenLabs and Fireflies who were pushing the boundaries. But I couldn't fully test the vision within a agency structure. So I left to find out: Can growth strategy consulting + building agentic AI systems create a new category?

This isn't me going solo as "just another growth consultant." It's partnering with startups to test how to best implement advanced growth strategies + co-building AI capabilities = fundamentally different outcomes.

## The Problem

Growth teams at early stage startups are underwater. You're running $50-200K/month in ads, trying to scale, but you can't afford a full growth team. Agencies want $20K+/month to use playbook strategies. AI tools promise magic but deliver narrow solutions that generate "AI work slop" (generic, context-free outputs that miss your business reality) because they don't understand your specific business context. Hundreds of new AI tools pop up daily and you can't trust any of them to handle high value work. You need strategic growth expertise that will take your business to the next level AND you need help finding efficiencies with AI leverage. You know AI could help, but nobody's offering a complete solution that you can use and build on.

The result: You're stuck choosing between adding more headcount to do the work or spending months trying to hack together dozens of siloed AI tools to find the efficiency unlock.

## The Opportunity

Partner with me to solve your growth challenges AND co-develop AI systems that become your competitive advantage. Not "here's my secret sauce" consulting. Not "buy my pre-built AI tool." Instead: We work together on your growth strategy and execution while building AI workflows specifically for your business—and you keep them.

**Here's what makes this different:** Instead of pre-built AI tools (generic outputs) or custom automation (expensive, brittle), we're building with Claude Code—a programmable AI assistant that learns your specific business.

Think of it as an AI co-worker, not a tool. You train it on your brand, metrics, and goals. It takes actions: analyzes campaigns, flags opportunities, generates creative, runs reports. Your team can modify it in natural language—no developers needed.

We build these together **while solving your actual growth challenges**, not in separate dev sprints. You see exactly how it works, can adjust it yourself, and own it completely.

Think: Fractional VP Growth who's also building AI systems alongside you (like AI co-workers for your team), then transferring full knowledge so you own them.

## What You Get

**Growth Expertise**
- Strategic planning and execution across paid acquisition, creative, analytics, experimentation
- Hands-on work: I'm in the accounts, analyzing metrics, building dashboards, reviewing creative, designing tests
- 15+ years experience scaling seed-stage companies through Series C+

**AI Systems Built Together**
- Custom AI systems and workflows tailored to your specific growth needs in Claude Code & n8n
- Real examples: Daily campaign analysis that spots anomalies. Creative testing that predicts winners before you spend. Ad copy generation tuned to your brand voice. Competitive intelligence that tracks what's working in your vertical.
- These become YOUR systems—full documentation, knowledge transfer, your team can modify and extend

**Speed + Quality Increase**
- I use AI to deliver faster, higher-quality results across strategy, execution, and analysis
- Instead of keeping this as "secret sauce," we're building it together so you get the multiplier effect
- Typical output: 3-5x improvement in workflow efficiency on specific tasks

## What I'm Looking For

**1-2 pilot partners who are:**
- Early stage (Seed through Series B) consumer/prosumer companies (bonus: subscription products)
- Running $50-200K/month in ad spend
- Need growth help but can't justify a full VP Growth hire
- Excited about AI implementation, not just cost savings
- Want to help shape what this becomes

**This is early-stage:**
- I'm not selling a finished product—we're co-developing
- You get premium expertise at a discount because you're helping me validate the model
- We figure out together what works and what doesn't
- High transparency: Regular check-ins on "Is this creating value?"

---

## The Ask

**Three things:**

1. **Feedback**: What am I missing? What sounds off? Is this solving major pain points? What would make this more compelling?

2. **Intros**: Know a seed-stage consumer company (subscription model, $50-200K/month ad spend) that needs growth help and is excited about AI?

3. **Gut check**: If you were running growth at a early-stage company, would this partnership model be interesting? Why or why not?

This is early. I'm figuring it out. But I think there's something here that's different from traditional consulting and agency models and different from AI tools—something that only works by co-building with the right partners.

## Appendix: Additional Details

## How It Works

**First 30 Days: Foundation + Quick Wins**
- Deep dive on your growth challenges and current systems
- Develop roadmap of prioritized opportunities (channels, creative, optimization)
- Identify 2-3 AI automation opportunities with highest immediate impact
- Build first AI workflow together while solving urgent growth needs
- Quick win goal: 2-5 working AI systems delivering measurable value

**Days 31-60: Expansion + Knowledge Transfer**
- Ongoing growth strategy and execution (paid, creative, analytics)
- Build 3-5 additional AI systems based on what's creating most value
- Knowledge transfer: Your team learns to maintain and extend the systems
- Documentation and handoff so you can continue independently

---

## Engagement Model

- 60-day pilot to start (focused on quick wins, not building everything)
- Fractional arrangement (roughly 5-10 hours/week focus)
- Pricing significantly below market for pilot partners
- Success = measurable growth improvement +5-10 AI systems you can use independently

**After the Pilot:**
If we're creating value, we can continue at market rates with ongoing development and growth execution. If not, you part ways with 5-10 working AI systems and no hard feelings. Either way, you keep everything we built.

## Proof Points

**Growth Track Record:**
- VP Growth at MAVAN: Employee #1, scaled from <$100K to seven figures
- 50+ clients including ElevenLabs, Fireflies, venture-backed startups
- Head of Growth at Digit: Doubled ARR year-over-year
- Director at Zynga: Managed $50M+ performance marketing budgets

**AI Implementation:**
- Spent last 6 months building AI POCs showing 3-5x improvements
- Worked with cutting-edge companies implementing AI in growth
- Built agents for creative production, data analysis, strategic planning
- Deep understanding of where AI actually helps vs. where it's hype

## AI Systems We Might Build Together

**Note:** We won't build all of these in 60 days. We'll prioritize based on your biggest needs and focus on 5-10 quick wins that deliver immediate value.

**Campaign Management & Optimization**
- Daily platform monitoring (Meta, Google, TikTok) with anomaly detection
- Budget allocation recommendations based on performance thresholds
- Auto-pause suggestions for underperforming campaigns
- Creative testing orchestration and systematic experimentation

**Creative Strategy & Production**
- Ad copy generation tuned to your brand voice and performance patterns
- Video script development (UGC, direct response formats)
- Creative performance analysis (what's working and WHY, not just metrics)
- Competitive creative intelligence tracking trends in your vertical

**Analytics & Strategic Insights**
- Weekly performance intelligence with actionable next steps
- Cross-channel ROAS analysis and pattern discovery
- Anomaly detection with explanations ("CAC went up because X, try Y")
- Experiment learnings library (institutional knowledge that compounds)

**What This Means:**
In our 60-day pilot, we'll likely build 5-10 of these based on what creates the most value for your business. Each one gets documented, your team gets trained, and you own it forever.

*Note: Any API costs or tool subscriptions for creative production would be covered by you.*
