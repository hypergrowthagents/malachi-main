### Personal Updates

- Moved to San Carlos from San Francisco
- Second child (2 months old) + 2.5 year old = chaos mode
- Wife’s family nearby providing support
- House hunting took 1.5 years, finally found one through strategic market timing
  - Avoided overpriced “honeypot” listings that attracted all bidders
  - Agent lived in neighborhood, provided local expertise
  - Walking distance to school district

### Singular Business Evolution

- Extract product gaining adoption but revenue impact limited
  - Customers using for “pennies or free”
  - Stuck within growth organizations, not breaking into broader enterprise
  - Not displacing Fivetran contracts as anticipated
- Reverse ETL functionality becoming the real growth driver
  - Audience fan-outs and copies integration
  - Companies pressured by Google/Facebook to integrate with CAPIs
  - Customers paying for full CDP (Segment, mParticle) when only need fan-out tool
  - Often hacking CDPs by faking events to qualify audience rules
- Position as foundational data layer + operational stack vs pure attribution

### Market Dynamics & Competition

- Growing faster than any other MMP despite mature market
- AppsFlyer still dominant but will match pricing when threatened
- AppLovin trying to sell Adjust (shrinking but still $120M+ ARR)
- Branch/Tune fading from major discussions
- Market shifting toward operational layer rather than just attribution

### AI Integration Feedback

- LLMs will likely eat most applications built on top of them
- Defensibility requires unique functionality or datasets
- Big need for giving companies AI starting points they can customize
- Agrees with thesis: LLMs poorly trained on growth examples, won’t excel naturally
- Integration challenges major barrier for agent platforms
  - Built translation layer for Singular MCP integration
  - Requires engineering resources, not plug-and-play APIs

### Enterprise AI Adoption Reality

- AI adoption “embarrassingly slow” among large customers
- IT restrictions limiting tool access (Gemini-only, Copilot-only mandates)
- Companies know they need AI but uncertain what’s approved
- Fewer requests for growth consultant recommendations recently

### Next Steps

- Continue dialogue on AI growth platform concept validation
- Malachirose to share pitch snippet for feedback on viability
- Multiple approach flavors still being evaluated (fractional vs agent platform focus)
