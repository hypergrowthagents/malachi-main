### Current Status & Transitions

- Malachirose left Maven after 1.5 years of direction divergence
  - Matt didn’t want to run growth agency anymore, lacked expansion ambitions
  - Considered CEO transition but didn’t make sense
  - Matt pivoting to PE fund for struggling businesses
- All parties departed amicably, potential consulting opportunities remain
- Currently pursuing fractional head of growth/CMO roles while building own offering

### AI Strategy Evolution & Learning

- Spent months heads-down on AI upskilling
  - Agent builder bootcamps, tool immersion, team training
  - Discovered automation fantasies vs reality: AI augments rather than replaces work
  - Can do more sophisticated things in same timeframe, not less work
- Scaled back from full AI agent platform ambitions
  - Recognized technical/execution risks without coding background
  - Shifted to AI-human augmentation model over 100% automation
- Key insight: Most valuable businesses may be 100% automated, but current sweet spot is hybrid approach

### Proposed Business Model

- Target: Pre-Series A companies needing generalist growth leader
- Two-layer offering:
  - Growth strategy (fractional CMO-style leadership)
  - Execution (customer acquisition with AI-enhanced capabilities)
- Position as “superpowered IC” doing 5 people’s jobs
- Include AI strategy component to make businesses “AI native”
- Focus on companies that would typically hire one growth generalist

### David’s Consulting Experience & Advice

- Built journalist network for content creation at scale
- Targeted Series B+ companies wanting execution with strategic thinking
- Structured project-based deliverables rather than outcome responsibility
- Current challenge: AI commoditizing content creation business model
  - Writer, Jasper, Typeface creating scaled content solutions
  - Enterprise-focused pricing models limiting access
- Key recommendation: Choose specific growth niche (B2B vs B2C, mobile vs e-commerce)
  - Different AI applications needed for different business models
  - Leverage existing client base to define initial focus

### Next Steps

- Malachirose to send draft services pitch for David’s feedback
- David to invite Malachirose to private AI community
- David to explore Vibe Marketers community
- Follow-up call scheduled: Tomorrow 3-4pm EST (noon-1pm PST)
