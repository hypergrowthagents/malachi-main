- Danielle pointed out that building a software platform is NOT my skill set. Even if I could build an agent platform for growth, the underlying tech and AI capabilities will be changing constantly and likely breaking those apps. I won’t be capable of keeping up.
- She really likes my idea of highlighting myself as a supercharged ICP - a growth leader augmented with AI OR a growth marketer augmented with AI - where using AI allows me to take on more clients, or earn more in less time. She thinks that’s a strong angle. And that I should absolutely call out all the ways that AI makes me more capable and efficient as selling points.
- I generally agree with her points. My own rebuttal is essentially:
	- There is value in building and demonstrating IP, which is likely most compelling if put into a front end UI like a client portal. Where a client can login and see the myriad “AI capabilities” they have access to and/or I can show off some of my workflows and mini-apps there.
	- There might be a version of AG where I build many mini-apps that do one task well rather than trying to build a cohesive platform that sells for much more. Potentially I have 20-50 mini apps that can each be purchased or used for a small amount, and I can build up a residual income stream from it, and it enhances my positioning as an AI driven growth marketer.
- Another hypothesis I have is that a lot of companies are seeking someone to come in and help them figure out how to implement AI within their teams. This is something that I may be able to attach to my own consulting or advising arrangements, similar to what I am doing with the DMS proposal. By hiring me, they're actually getting somebody who's coming in and transforming AI alongside working with the team, teaching them the ropes, implementing processes, and giving them this capability. That's going to be in high demand for quite a while. I still need to figure out exactly how I position it, how I package and price it, and so on. But at a minimum, it's a feature that just makes my general offering for consulting where someone is hiring me more attractive. 
- if we follow the logic do this advice, where I focus on making AG positioning about how AI turns me into a super IC, then I should focus my time in building AI agents/apps that directly make it easier for me to do my own work, and ignore everything else. That way I stay narrowly focused on driving impact in the areas that matter.

## 9/17/25 Meeting

- In our next meeting, show the milestones to hit	
- What do we need to hit?	
- What is the go/no go?	
- Decisions we need to make today	
- Blockers and risks discussion	
- What's realistic and what's not with the model? Where might it make sense to be more aggressive or conservative	
- Goal: By 8 weeks, money is flowing in in some capacity, whether via consulting or agents	
- Spend a significant amount of time reaching out to my network about this. Do that every day bite size. Start nurturing my network	
- Lean into AI uses where I'm already most strong and comfortable	
- Thinks the idea of a human being superpowered by AI is going to be more attractive by AI. Talk about how I built all of these agents and I can run them all and can do the work of 5 people, but I'm able to do this all by being augmented by AI here. This seems like a smart starting point.	
	- The system is only as good as the person sold with it.
