Don't don't sweat it man I think this is like a sort of natural Early stages type of feeling, and you wouldn't be the first you know I always just go back to what the customer wants like the answer. I think really is likely to be find the customer first then worry about like how exactly you're gonna deliver the thing like at the end of the day we're talking about is customer acquisition. Find someone who needs help with customer acquisition and believes in you. And the way that you want to go about doing it because these differences as far as I can tell are mostly about tools and engagement like the way you're gonna engage with these folks and I think if you instead just like go find clients Then that other stuff is good to just shake out and what you wanna do is try to find client that are somewhat consistent with one another, but it might also be that you find a few different clients and then you look for the commonalities between them and develop your service around that but again like A lot of times what I found to be more successful in pitching is to just echoes people's words back to them anyway so like it really is like go to your friends figure out who needs help and then write a pitch for how you will help them specifically with their problems and the AI stuff is great and you should mention it because that I think be compelling to them as a way to like carry forward whatever you do at relative cost either with or without you depending on what you think the model is likely to be But the important thing is like it's about customer acquisition you're an expert at it. You have a bunch of experience doing it like you have you know, friends and companies that could probably use this go and just talk to them first understand what their problems are figure out how you can maybe fix it and then with the AI stuff in once you already have the rest of that framework set.

## Malachi’s Response 

that's really helpful advice. thanks man. if I had to paraphrase that advice, it would be:

  

1. to have conversations with potential customers that I believe have the types of problems that I want to solve. my market essentially 

2. to position this as growth consulting focused on solving their customer acquisition needs. 

3. use this as a chance in the pitch to connect it with how I plan to use AI to actually do this differently and leave them with some lasting artifacts they can use internally to run this officially themselves. 

4. and then just go off and do this a couple of times and learn from there. 

  

does that capture the intent or did I miss anything important?
