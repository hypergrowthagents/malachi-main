  - Parents discussing “exit plans” - unprecedented situation

### Derek’s Business Journey & Pivot

- Previous co-founder issues
  - Started AI/Salesforce configuration business 2.5 years ago
  - Co-founder (married to Heather’s friend) proved difficult to work with
  - Fired entire team in March due to irreconcilable working relationship
- Current business: Superframe
  - Pivoted from CRM to comprehensive activity/signal tracking
  - Goal: 360-degree view of all customer interactions (sales, support, marketing)
  - Freemium model inspired by Fireflies success (350k customers, 20M users)
  - Charge based on number of activities tracked
  - New co-founder joining with significant equity stake
  - Planning to raise couple million for restart

### AI-Enabled Growth Business Strategy

- Why AI-enabled solutions work better
  - Primary advantage: cheaper than traditional agencies
  - Can take on more clients with higher margins
  - AI enables the solution but can’t be the core value proposition
- Messaging challenges with guarantees
  - Performance guarantees are tricky because they’ve been promised before
  - Everyone markets performance-based solutions - message needs differentiation
  - Guarantees help conversion but won’t convince uninterested prospects

### Audience Targeting & Differentiation Strategies

- PostHog as model for audience-specific messaging
  - Doesn’t claim to be better than Segment - claims to be “FOR YOU” (engineers)
  - Desktop website design speaks directly to developer audience
  - Don’t need to differentiate value prop - can differentiate identity and communication style
- Sentry’s approach
  - Removed tracking pixels (audience hates being tracked)
  - Funds open source projects that align with target users
  - Better growth than performance marketing achieved
- Key principle: narrow market focus
  - Mode vs Tableau example: focused on people who already understood the difference
  - Avoid explaining differences - find people who already “get it”
  - Small markets acceptable for non-venture-funded individual consulting

### Customer Acquisition Focus & Market Validation

- Recommendation to narrow from broad “growth operations” to specific customer acquisition
- Most important strategic advice: intentionally narrow market
  - Find audience segment 100% consistent in desires and messaging preferences
  - Example: startups under 10 employees, $10k-$100k revenue, selling to technical audiences
- Market research approach
  - Talk to 25 people in target audience
  - Subsegment further based on consistent patterns
  - Look for technical founders without business/marketing experience
  - Derek offered Clay credits to help build prospect lists

### Implementation & Technical Approach

- Services-first strategy makes sense
  - Hedge against unproven agent capabilities
  - Build and perfect agents through real-world usage
  - Graduate proven agents to self-service tier
  - Human + AI model may be permanent viable approach
- Technical details less important than market fit
  - Focus 100% on what audience wants and will pay for
  - Delivery method (AI vs people in Estonia) doesn’t matter to customers
  - Startup audience good fit since they’re also finding their market

### Next Steps & Action Items

- Malachirose to complete
  - Write refined 1-2 page pitch for Derek’s feedback
  - Read “The Mom Test” (audiobook)
  - Conduct 25 customer interviews with target audience segmentation
  - Set up research call with Derek as potential client in 2 weeks
- Derek to send
  - “Wok” cookbook by Kenji Lopez-Alt
  - Support with Clay credits for prospect research when needed
