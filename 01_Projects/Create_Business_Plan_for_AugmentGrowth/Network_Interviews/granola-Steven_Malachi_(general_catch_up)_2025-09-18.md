### Steven’s ClickUp Opportunity Dilemma

- Potential role at ClickUp with significant equity upside
  - Company: 300M ARR, targeting IPO at 600M in next 24 months
  - Expected outcome: potentially millions in equity
  - Workload concern: 60 hours/week for 3+ years during IPO prep
- Family considerations with 3 kids (including 10-month-old baby)
  - Values: helping kids get ready for school, family dinners, basic life activities
  - Risk: might miss these years, potential strain on marriage
- Currently at Calm (3.5 years) - direct to consumer side
  - Role becoming “boring and dumb” - less innovative, fewer big swings
  - Unspoken exit plan: eventual sale to UnitedHealth (currently blocked by UnitedHealth issues)
  - DTC side deprioritized as company focuses on enterprise healthcare

### Malachirose’s AI-Powered Growth Strategy

- Two potential paths being considered:
  - AI-enabled fractional CMO/CGO services - higher value, less scalable
  - Agent platform development - more scalable, higher risk
- Steven’s recommendation: pursue boutique service approach
  - Market gap: younger people AI-fluent but lack domain knowledge, experienced people have domain knowledge but lack AI skills
  - Positioning as bridge between AI capabilities and business expertise
- Key insight: come into companies, implement AI capabilities, teach teams, take ownership of specific areas for high impact

### Pricing and Market Positioning Feedback

- $15k/month seems high for narrow scope
  - Either go smaller scope/smaller price point or larger scope to justify cost
  - Need broader capability set beyond single function
- Hybrid pricing model: SaaS layer + advisory knowledge component
- Target market: SMBs to 50-100 person companies in scale mode
  - Value prop: “do more with less” during hiring freezes
- Engagement structure: 3-6 month implementations with team training component

### Implementation Challenges and Opportunities

- IT security hurdles at larger companies
  - Data training restrictions - tools cannot train on company data
  - Requirement for discrete data handling agreements
  - May limit opportunities at health companies or data-sensitive organizations
- Competitive landscape analysis needed
  - Map existing tools companies currently use/consider
  - Differentiate from current fragmented market solutions
  - Example mentioned: Poppy AI (https://poppy.ai) at $700/year for creative development

### Next Steps and Collaboration Ideas

- Malachirose to develop pitch deck for Steven’s feedback
- Potential collaboration opportunities:
  - If Steven takes ClickUp role - advisory capacity to help with AI implementation
  - If Steven takes break - direct collaboration on AI ventures
- Malachirose’s immediate plan: rapid prototyping phase
  - 1-2 day sprints building MVP capabilities
  - Focus areas: creative testing, UGC generation, analytics tools
  - Goal: prove out concepts before deeper investment
