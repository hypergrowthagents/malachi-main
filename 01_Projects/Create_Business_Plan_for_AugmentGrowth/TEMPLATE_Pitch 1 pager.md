## Meta Notes

**Keep each section tight** - This should be readable in 3-4 minutes max

**Test questions for feedback**:
1. Is the problem real and urgent for this buyer?
2. Is the solution differentiated enough to command premium pricing?
3. Would you pay $X/month for this if you were the buyer?
4. Who specifically should I talk to about this?

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:
- Generic "we help companies grow" language
- Feature lists without outcomes
- Vague ideal customer profiles
- Process-heavy descriptions of "how we work"
