---

## 12. Pricing & Revenue Model Analysis

### Pricing Psychology

**Value Metric:** Ad spend managed (proxy for company size/value delivered)
- Free: $250K/month ad spend max = small businesses
- Pro: $250K/month ad spend max = small-to-mid businesses
- Max: $2M/month ad spend max = mid-to-large businesses
- Custom: $2M+ = enterprises

**Price Points:**
- $99/month Pro = accessible for individual marketers/small agencies
- $299/month Max = agency/team tier
- ~$0.50-$1.00 per $1K ad spend managed (rough calculation)

**Competitive Price Positioning:**
- Likely cheaper than full-service agencies (10-20% of spend)
- More expensive than basic analytics tools (TripleWhale ~$129-299)
- MCP free tier creates wide funnel for eventual conversion

### Revenue Streams

1. **SaaS Subscriptions** (Pro/Max/Custom plans)
2. **Agency Services** (AI-assisted performance marketing)
3. **Potential:** Affiliate revenue from Claude Pro referrals (MCP requires Claude Pro)
