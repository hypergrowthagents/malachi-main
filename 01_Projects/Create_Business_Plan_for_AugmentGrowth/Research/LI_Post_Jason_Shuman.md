    Vertical AI is a dogfight right now. For both Founders and Investors  
      
    Bill Gurley said to me a few months ago he wouldn’t wish on anyone the battle Uber and Lyft went through...I'm seeing this play out across the board.  
      
    Yesterday, I walked a conference floor in one of the verticals we focus on. I counted 20 booths with what felt like the exact same pitch.  
      
    In Vertical AI, every idea ends up with 3–20+ competitors. The tech itself won’t decide the winners. Execution will.  
      
    The companies that break out will need to run harder than everyone else and be incredibly intentional on at least these four important fronts:  
      
    1. Distribution Advantage: Who can find and convert leads the fastest and in a repeatable, defensible way. Whether it is through incredibly strong content marketing, partnerships or a built in flywheel, or something else, grind away to find this.  
      
    2. Positioning: When 25 companies sound the same, differentiation wins. Are you leading with the same metrics and messaging as everyone else or does your voice stand out and POV stand out?  
      
    3. Pricing: This is actually where I think things are going to get the most interesting. Will you give away some modules that others charge for? Will you be outcome based while others are SaaS or Usage based? Study your market deeply and find your edge. It'll pay off.  
      
    4. Onboarding speed: This is the bottleneck for so many AI companies. The faster you onboard, the more case studies you get to market, the more word-of-mouth you get and the more cash you get in your bank account. With more cash and more case studies you can reinvest in growth way more than your competition, raise more capital than anyone and block out the noise.  
      
    Founders need to bring an intensity today to both GTM and learning about their competition & market that is at a whole different level.  
      
    Because in this dogfight, speed and execution feel like they might be the only unfair advantages.
