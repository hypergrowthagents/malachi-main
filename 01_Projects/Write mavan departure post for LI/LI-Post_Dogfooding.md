It's important to dogfood your own product. Who else has both the internal context of what your product is aiming to solve combined with the experience of actually solving it? That's a perfect feedback loop that can help you iterate quickly.

I see a lot of companies skip that step because they think it gets faster results to skip straight to customer feedback.

It's helpful to realize your product isn't ready by testing it on yourself than to do your first live trial with paying customers - they are going to keep you busy with feedback and issues.

Move on to testing it live with customers as the next logical step once you have the core value promise in place.
