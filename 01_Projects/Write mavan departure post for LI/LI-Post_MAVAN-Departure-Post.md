After 4.5 incredible years at MAVAN, I'm stepping back from my leadership role and will be pursuing new adventures in growth + AI. I can't help but be thankful for all that I've learned and experienced during my time there, and all of the amazing clients I had the pleasure to work with.

When I started at MAVAN, I was really deep in mobile gaming and fintech. At first, I had imposter syndrome, thinking I probably didn't have that much to offer outside of the vertical expertise I had accumulated. In my time here, I learned that strategy and tactics are constantly changing, but the battle tested growth methods/processes holdup regardless.

Now it's wild to think about the many dozens of startups we've helped over the years, ranging from AI leaders, AI disruptors, fintech apps, subscription apps, celebrity ecom, fitness, health, education, crypto, B2B saas, public companies, pre-seed venture ideas, any many more.

Special thanks to @Matt, @Ellyn, @Jan for the years of collaboration. I'm super optimistic about the direction you're headed and will continue to support where I can.

As for my next steps, I'm working on a new venture which I'll share more about soon. I may also have room for 1 additional growth/AI advisor role, so feel free to reach out if you know someone who needs help cracking the growth code.
