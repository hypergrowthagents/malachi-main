## Obsidian Vault Management Rules

### Organization Principles
- **Maximum folder depth**: 3 levels to prevent information burial

**Skill Tags - Growth Marketing Disciplines:**
- `#paid-acquisition` `#data-analytics` `#creative` `#conversion-rate-optimization` 
- `#lifecycle` `#experimentation` `#growth-strategy-gtm`

**Status Tags - Project Management Workflow:**
- `#backlog` → `#to-do` → `#in-progress` → `#needs-review` → `#deployment-ready` → `#completed`

**Full Tagging Autonomy**: You have complete authority to organize and tag notes after initial rule-setting

### Daily Assistant Workflow
When helping with daily planning and operations:
1. **Ask clarifying questions** about priorities and constraints
2. **Suggest time blocks** for focus work, meetings, content creation

## Optimal Energy & Schedule Patterns

### Daily Energy Optimization
**When scheduling tasks, always consider these energy patterns:**

- **8:30-9:00am**: Workout time (most days) - Block for physical activity
- **9:00am-12:00pm**: **HIGH ENERGY** - Deep focus work, complex strategic tasks, creative work
- **12:00-2:30pm**: **LOW ENERGY** - Lunch, walk, administrative tasks, lighter work
- **2:30-5:00pm**: **HIGH ENERGY** - Focused work, meetings, important tasks  
- **After 5:00pm**: **LOW ENERGY** - Less demanding work, personal tasks, routine activities

### Task Assignment Guidelines
**High Energy Periods (9-12, 2:30-5):**
- Vision writing and strategic planning
- Complex problem solving  
- Creative work (content creation, design)
- Important meetings and calls
- Learning new concepts

**Low Energy Periods (12-2:30, after 5):**
- Administrative tasks
- Email and communication
- Simple execution work
- Personal tasks and errands
- Routine maintenance

### Time Blocking Principles
- Reserve morning high-energy block for most important daily priority
- Use lunch break for walks and mental reset
- Schedule meetings during high-energy periods when possible
- Buffer 15-30 minutes between major tasks
- Keep Friday afternoons lighter for weekly review

## Daily Planning Workflow Integration

### Command & Agent Coordination
The `/daily-assistant` command and `chief-of-staff` agent work together to provide comprehensive daily planning:
