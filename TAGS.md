# Tagging Strategy & Rules

This document defines the comprehensive tagging system for the Obsidian vault. Claude has full autonomy to apply and evolve these tags after initial rule-setting.

## Core Tagging Principles

- **Hybrid Organization**: Tags complement folder structure for cross-cutting themes
- **Granular Specificity**: Use detailed tags for precise categorization and retrieval
- **Consistent Application**: Apply tags systematically across all notes
- **Evolution Allowed**: Tags can be refined and expanded as the system grows

## Tagging Best Practices

### Application Guidelines
1. **Minimum 2-3 tags per note** for sufficient categorization
2. **Maximum 8-10 tags per note** to avoid over-tagging
3. **Always include at least one content type tag**
4. **Add status tag for actionable items**
5. **Use date tags for time-sensitive content**

### Linking Strategy
- Create `[[wiki-style links]]` between related notes
- Use tags to find cross-cutting themes across folders
- Tag relationships: `#paid-acquisition` often pairs with `#data-analytics`
- Link accomplishments to relevant skill demonstrations

### Search & Discovery
**Common Tag Combinations:**
- `#accomplishment` + `#mavan-experience` + specific skill tags
- `#company-research` + `#ai-startup` + `#interview-prep`
- `#content-idea` + skill tags + `#linkedin`
- `#daily-note` + current month + priority tags

**Query Examples:**
- Find all MAVAN accomplishments: `tag:#accomplishment AND tag:#mavan-experience`
- Current active projects: `tag:#in-progress`
- Content creation opportunities: `tag:#content-idea AND tag:#to-do`
- Today's tasks: `tag:#today AND tag:#to-do`
- Quick wins available: `tag:#quick-win AND tag:#to-do`
- Blocked items needing attention: `tag:#blocked`
- All task management notes: `tag:#task-list OR tag:#daily-planning OR tag:#weekly-review`
- Backlog items ready for promotion: `tag:#backlog-item AND tag:#high-priority`

## Tag Evolution & Maintenance

### Adding New Tags
- New skill areas as expertise expands
- Industry-specific tags as focus areas develop
- Client-specific tags if working with recurring clients
- Tool-specific tags for software and platforms used

### Tag Cleanup
- Monthly review of rarely-used tags
- Consolidate similar tags when appropriate
- Archive tags that no longer serve a purpose
- Ensure consistent spelling and formatting

### Cross-Reference Updates
- Keep this document updated as tags evolve
- Update CLAUDE.md when major tagging changes occur
- Review templates to ensure consistent tag application
