I strongly recommend everyone read this: Brian Balfour just dropped a banger of a blog post about how AI is fundamentally reshaping how businesses survive and succeed.

There are some ominous warnings in there for all of us, and this is something worth pondering - how will your business adapt to these changes?

As a growth operator, I’m particularly interested in his points about channel market fit collapse:

- **Cost increases break GTM**
- **Channel collapses could trigger monetization changes**
- **Shifts in user adoption behavior**

Which could lead to one of these 5 fatal scenarios:

1. Danger Zone: ARPU too low for sales teams, too high/complex for viral/paid channels
2. Mass exodus: Cheaper AI competitors trigger customer churn while you can’t adapt channels fast enough
3. CAC death spiral: Panic spending on AI consultants/marketing without ROI destroys unit economics
4. Pricing chaos: Rushed re-pricing and re-bundling creates market confusion and internal misalignment
5. Forced market moves: AI commoditization pushes you up-market (expensive sales teams) or down-market (low-friction channels) - both risky pivots

I’m truly curious to see how legacy businesses deal with these - especially #2 and #4.

The upshot: adopt a survival mindset. Monitor Channel Model Fit religiously and build monetization flexibility BEFORE you’re forced to change under pressure.

One additional observation:

There’s pressure on the freemium model. Consumers expect AI to be in products and expect products to be free, but token usage has real costs for companies. How do they continue to afford fueling freemium growth?

My take:

Many should keep a freemium tier but use lower-cost AI models to serve them - models tuned to deliver 80% of the value of higher-cost models. I don’t think companies can afford to ditch freemium or hold back AI capabilities in a market where consumers expect these things.

Wild times we live in.
