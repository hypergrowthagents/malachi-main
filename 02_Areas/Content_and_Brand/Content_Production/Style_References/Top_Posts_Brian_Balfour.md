The GPT-5 launch was not about a new model. It was about reaching the next BILLION users. The hype promised a revolutionary new model. Users felt disappointed. But here's what actually happened:  
  
It's been weeks (ages in AI) since GPT-5 launched. The marketing hype has cleared and the too quick user reactions have settled down.  
  
OpenAI wasn't building for power users anymore. They were building for the next billion.  
  
The real changes:  
  
Automatic model switching - No more choosing between GPT-4, 4o, or 5  
Faster responses - Speed matters more than IQ for most users  
Simple personalization - Change colors, not prompts  
  
These are moves to reinforce their lead on being a consumer AI platform.  
  
They solve for what [Bangaly Kaba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iambangaly/) called "The Adjacent User." Bangaly learned this during his time at Instagram (now at YouTube).  
  
Your early adopters understand model differences. Your next billion users don't even know models exist. They just want ChatGPT to work.  
  
So while tech Twitter debated benchmarks, OpenAI quietly removed every friction point for mainstream users. Result? Higher retention. More usage. Market dominance.  
  
They doubled down a week later with ChatGPT Go for India. Same playbook.  
  
[Fareed Mosavat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fareed/) and I broke this down on a recent podcast episode.

Who in my network is doing customer interviews? I have another new product to show you. [Reforge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reforge/) AI User Interviewer…  
  
If time weren’t a constraint, I’d talk to every customer of Reforge (repeatedly). I learn an incredible amount every time I do.  
  
But I’m often faced with the predicament many product teams face. To get new customer understanding, I need to either:  
  
1. Blast out a survey. Which is convenient and scalable, but I don’t get the depth I want.  
2. Try to schedule 20 interviews. But that can take weeks, tons of calendar coordination, and honestly, be inconvenient for a lot of our customers.  
  
That’s why I’m super excited about the Reforge AI Interviewer. It helps automate the end-to-end experience. You get the depth of interviews, at the scale and convenience of surveys.  
  
Most importantly, I think it’s a better experience for customers which leads to higher opt-in rates, more brutally honest feedback, and faster learning.  
  
Here is how it works:  
  
1. Tell it your learning goal  
2. AI generates a draft of an interview plan based on best practices.  
3. Send a link to your audience.  
4. Your audience can engage in a full, engaging, dynamic conversation with the AI on their own time.  
5. The results are automatically synthesized, connected to all of your other feedback sources, joined with your business metrics, and a lot more.  
  
Check out more here: [https://lnkd.in/gDMwYabJ](https://lnkd.in/gDMwYabJ)  
  
Also, take it for a test spin. I'll drop a link to an example interview on the topic of AI tools below.

Your AI tools need to know your customer just as well as you do.  
We just made that super easy...  
  
ChatGPT helping you write PRDs?  
Cursor helping you implement a solution?  
Claude helping draft strategy?  
  
None of them know your users pains, needs, and wants out of the box. Maybe you are manually copying/pasting tidbits of customer feedback.  
  
But how do you get your AI tools to understand your customers at the depth of your most tenured employee?  
  
We just launched [Reforge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reforge/) Insights MCP to fix this. Now your AI tools can access real-time user feedback directly—every complaint, every praise, every pattern.  
  
Works in tools like [Claude](https://www.linkedin.com/company/claude/), [Cursor](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cursorllc/), [ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chatgpt/), [Windsurf](https://www.linkedin.com/company/windsurf/), and more.  
  
Through the MCP they can access:  
  
✓ Real-time user feedback analysis  
✓ Quantified complaint themes  
✓ Actual customer quotes  
✓ Cross-platform feedback synthesis  
  
Demo video with Claude and Cursor below!

Lots of talk on how AI is changing monetization models (outcome-based, usage models, etc). Not enough talk on AI is changing the psychology of purchasing decisions.  
  
The fundamental principle still applies. To convert someone to a customer this equation must compute:  
  
Perceived Value > Perceived Price + Friction  
  
AI has changed the psychology around all three of those components.

A brilliant product idea is worthless if nobody gets it. So steal this prompt to sell the idea to your team, boss, and customers.  
  
One of my favorite uses of AI is to package my ideas into compelling narratives.  
  
It's easy to watch ideas crash and burn, not because they sucked, but because they are pitched like robots reading spec docs.  
  
Your boss, your peers, your customers. They are all human.  
  
No one has thought about your idea as much as you have. Humans need ideas packaged in ways that immediately fit what they care about.  
  
This prompt helps craft that narrative. It has a few different pieces:  
  
Your Initiative  
This is the thing you are trying to communicate. Your product strategy, a feature idea, a marketing initiative.  
  
Target Audience  
This is the audience consuming your idea. Your team, your customer, your boss. The better you describe them, the better the output you'll get.  
  
Narrative Structure  
There are proven storytelling structures. Use them! My favorite is one I adapted from Andy Raskin's strategic narrative framework. It's embedded in the prompt, but you can easily replace.  
  
The output drafts a story that takes your specific initiative, packages it in a proven story structure, for your specific audience.

"The battle for every startup comes down to whether the startup gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation."  
  
- Alex Rampell, General Partner at a16z  
  
What Alex is describing is escape velocity. Escape velocity is even more critical in the age of AI.  
  
Escape velocity is what gives you the opportunity to sequence to some type of defensibility. Escape velocity is a required ingredient to any moat.  
  
On one hand massive AI interest has sparked massive adoption of new AI tools allowing some startups to hit escape velocity in record time. For them the question is if they will seize the opportunity to a moat quickly.  
  
But for others there are 3+ other forces:  
  
1. AI has made it easier for incumbents to copy faster.  
2. AI has made created more startup competition in every category.  
3. Organic distribution like SEO is on the decline.  
  
and finally...  
  
4. That massive AI interest? The novelty will wear off at some point.  
  
This is creating "The Big Squeeze." Startups must get escape velocity in much shorter periods of time before the innovations get copied. More below.

Claude's new AI-powered Apps feature does something clever: it turns every app into a growth engine for the platform itself. A growth model enabled by a unique set of design constraints...  
  
Claude AI-powered apps are like apps you might build with other AI app builders, but with two interesting constraints:  
  
1. Users of the apps authenticate w/ their existing Claude account.  
2. Usage counts against the end users Claude subscription, not the creators.  
  
These constraints set up something very interesting.  
  
1. Every app created on Claude will drive more users/engagement back to Claude due to the authentication.  
2. Even more important, each app created has its own set of growth loops driving users back to Claude.  
  
The net result what we might call "nested loops"—the core creation-sharing loop at the platform level, plus individual sharing and engagement loops within each created application.  
  
The growth compounds not just through individual creators, but through the growth mechanisms built into their individual apps.  
  
A few lessons:  
  
1. AI is enabling new variations of growth loops and growth models.  
2. Constraints enable new opportunities.  
3. The key in growth models is always how you align incentives across all participants in the loop.

OpenAI just dropped ChatGPT agent mode. I'll spare you the "The world just changed again..." broetry. But it’s another important piece of The Next Great Distribution Shift, which I wrote about here:  
  
[https://lnkd.in/gVeaEJXa](https://lnkd.in/gVeaEJXa)  
  
Distribution Shifts  
That post explained the cycle that new distribution platforms go through.  
  
1. Competitive environment forms. ✅  
2. They identify the moat. ✅  
3. They launch an "open" platform to accrue more of the moat.  
4. They close the platform to monetize.  
  
Part of my prediction was that ChatGPT would be the winning platform and that part of their distribution channel would be an Agent Platform.  
  
They’ve been laying the foundation with memory, context, and connectors. They've been hiring for "Agent Platform" roles.  
  
Today, they’ve launched agent mode as the next piece.  
  
It’s a general-purpose agent combining their Deep Research and Operator models.  
  
But they will need to introduce more specific agents at some point in order to drive adoption. Most users have issues with general-purpose tools. They can be used for so many things, they don't know what to use them for.  
  
The general purpose agent will never cover the infinite set of use cases out there.  
  
For that, I think OpenAI launches an agent platform and we run through the distribution cycle again.  
  
What happens next?  
  
1. They’ll continue expanding their data connectors to collect more context.  
2. They will likely launch third-party-built agents via preferred partnerships.  
3. They will then open up a platform. To incentivize developers, they will likely have some distribution mechanism built in.  
  
At some point they will close the distribution mechanisms down in order to monetize.  
  
Whether or not I'm right about ChatGPT, it's important to know the game. As I wrote in my post:  
  
"The clock isn't just ticking, it's accelerating. And in this game, the house always wins. But if you play it right, you can win too—at least for a while.  
  
Choose wisely. Move deliberately. And whatever you do, don't be naive.  
The next great distribution shift isn't coming. It's here. And whether you're ready or not, you're already playing."

I think most companies are lying to themselves about internal AI adoption. There is a large gap between the executive memos declaring “we’re AI first” and what’s actually happening.  
  
I talked to two groups: VP/C-level leaders, and individual contributors on the front lines.  
  
The pattern I saw over and over was a huge delta between executive expectations of rapid transformation and the frontline reality of people still figuring it out.  
  
Change only happens at the speed of the slowest part of your AI adoption system. The first step is understanding where the slowest part is. There were 5 real barriers I found:  
  
↳ Political barriers - Role boundaries are dissolving but org charts haven't adapted  
↳ Retrofitting trap - Teams layer AI onto existing processes instead of reimagining them  
↳ Procurement paralysis - Legal/IT creates months of delays for low-risk experimentation  
↳ Knowledge gaps - Surface-level understanding isn't enough for real transformation  
↳ Permission anxiety - People afraid to experiment because boundaries are unclear  
  
Working through these barriers requires a system that will drive real behavior change. Of the few percent of companies I saw leading the frontline of adoption there were 5 common elements:  
  
↳ Constraints - Force new behaviors by making AI adoption easier than reverting to old ways  
↳ Ownership - CEO-level leadership driving transformation, not delegating to working groups  
↳ Directives - 2-3 concrete, actionable instructions per team (not vague "use AI more")  
↳ Expectations - Specific behavioral standards people can understand and measure  
↳ Rewards - Integration into performance reviews, promotions, and career advancement  
  
The stakes are higher with AI transformation. Those too it first will widen the gap between them and competitors at a faster rate.  
  
The window is still open, but it’s closing fast.

🆕 New Essay: The Next Great Distribution Shift  
The $100B cycle hiding in plain sight…  
  
As [Casey Winters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseywinters/) said a year ago, AI has been a technology shift without a distribution shift.  
  
But I think that’s about to change.  
  
Here is my detailed framework and prediction: [https://lnkd.in/gVeaEJXa](https://lnkd.in/gVeaEJXa)  
  
Every platform follows the same brutal playbook:  
  
Open → Grow → Close → Monetize  
  
↳ Facebook did it. Zynga lost 90% of its traffic overnight.  
↳ Google did it. Organic results now start on scroll 8.  
↳ Apple did it. 30% tax on $100B+ annually.  
↳ LinkedIn is doing it RIGHT NOW. (Notice your reach dropping?)  
  
I want to educate people on this history so that you know how to navigate it. Because this time, the stakes are higher and the window will be shorter.  
  
The pattern is predictable:  
  
1. Competitive environment of a major category emerges (search, mobile, social, now AI) with no clear winner.  
2. The moat is identified in the category  
3. The strongest player opens gates to developers/creators with "free" access to grow and get more of what they need for the moat  
4. Closes for monetization once they hit escape velocity  
  
This pattern is about to repeat itself. The first two conditions of the cycle have been met:  
  
1. We have a competitive environment with no clear winner between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and maybe Apple around AI.  
2. The moat has been identified. Context + Memory.  
  
So who is going to be the one to make the platform move? My prediction is on OpenAI and ChatGPT.  
  
↳ They have 700M users on ChatGPT  
↳ They have the highest retention and engagement in the category  
↳ There have been a slew of job postings hiring around an “Agent Platform”  
↳ They’ve made their first move with integrations to HubSpot, Linear, and others.  
  
The next part of this playbook is to open up more. Attract more developers to create more usage, which captures more context/memory.  
  
After there is clear escape velocity from the other players, they will close it down to monetize. I think the full cycle lasts < 2 years from this point.  
  
The reality is that there is no opting out of the game. It's just how well you play it. This is the prisoner's dilemma of platform shifts. Everyone knows how it ends, but everyone plays because the alternative is worse.  
  
Choose wisely. Move deliberately. And whatever you do, don't be naive.  
  
The next great distribution shift isn't coming. It's here. And whether you're ready or not, you're already playing.
