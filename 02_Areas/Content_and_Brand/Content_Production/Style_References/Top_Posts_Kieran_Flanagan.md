Google is expanding Gemini into Chrome, along with "agentic browsing". If you thought the death of 'clicks' was bad, this is the death of the 'web page'.  
  
Google is cooking with their AI launches. This will be one of the most impactful for the average user.  
  
Here's a quick rundown of key features (they are awesome):  
  
1. Ask about this page + suggested questions  
  
Old way: You'd click through to a web page and read it. If you didn't get all the answers, you'd search again.  
  
New way: Gemini turns the web page into 'context'. Instead of reading the page, you ask Gemini questions about it. You don't need to read it. Plus, Gemini will give you suggested prompts/questions.  
  
2. Multi-tab understanding & summarisation  
  
Old way: You do research, open 10 tabs (for me, more like 100), copy-paste notes between them.  
  
New way: Gemini ingests all the data across tabs, giving you a single context window to query. So so good. No need to read pages.  
  
3. Address bar AI model + follow-ups  
  
Old way: You'd search by rewriting queries until you hit the right results  
  
New way: Type one query into the URL bar, and then keep asking follow-ups. The "search box' becomes a conversation.  
  
4. Memory of past sessions  
  
Old way: Bookmark things you want to revisit, but you never do  
  
New way: Gemini remembers historical context. It remembers pages you've visited and picks up where you left off. Wow.  
  
5. Agentic tasks + Google app integrations  
  
Old way: Click through multiple sites to get things done (booking, shopping, checking maps).  
  
New way: Gemini acts for you. It books tickets, resetting leaked passwords (so cool), pulling info from Gmail or Calendar. The big one for me is better search of Gmail. This isn't good today.  
  
---  
  
My Take  
  
- These are amazing for the user  
- Tough for Perplexity  
- This is great for Google, it will increase search/question volume, they can monetize through intent-advertising, like AI Max, but with fewer clicks and now the user doesn't even need to read the web page.

Life of a tech worker in 2026,  
  
- Joins Zoom call 2 mins early and is greeted by 20 note-taking apps, zero humans  
- Your digital twin outperforms you and gets promoted  
- You're told to 'collaborate' more, but 90% of your team are agents  
- Your job title is the same, but the job is just asking ChatGPT to do your work and begging it to "check your sources are true"  
- The company announces "AI-first culture", which means they laid off everyone except George, who knows how to keep servers going.  
- You watch AI Influencers for inspiration, they tell you "99% of people do everything wrong, here's how the 1% do it," and it is regurgitated points from ChatGPT  
- All your friends who were laid off are now 'creators', automating comments on LinkedIn  
- Your AI note-taking app just employed another note-taking app to do its job  
- You interview for new roles; first question, why hire you vs. ask ChatGPT to do this  
- The AI assistant that now manages you gives a presentation on "The Burden of Managing Humans."  
- You finally get laid off and replaced by an agent. HR asks can you write your own termination letter so they can train AI to do this in the future  
- You ask your AI assistant, which acts as your career mentor, for advice, and it tells you 99% of people are doing it wrong. Have you considered doing it like the 1%  
- You become a creator and search for software to put your "LinkedIn comments on steroids"  
  
The END!

A lot of marketing roles will be disrupted by AI. But I'm witnessing firsthand how adopting an AI-driven marketing playbook will create new roles. Here are five I'd invest in:  
  
1. AI Engineer: The AI engineer is the person obsessed with AI, a systems thinker who can start to integrate AI across your human-led marketing workflows. Skilled in tools like Replit, Lovable, n8n, Zapier, and Gumloop. Critical to go deep with AI.  
  
2. AI Trainer: The AI trainer ensures your agents excel at their jobs. As you deploy more agents across your GTM, you'll need someone skilled at training those agents. I've seen this firsthand. An agent that sells on your website, an agent that does the first 30 days onboarding, and an agent that upsells paying customers. All need training, iteration, and feedback.  
  
3. AEO (AI Engine Optimisation): Evolution of the SEO team. Today, 80% of the buyer's journey begins with a Google search; tomorrow, it starts with a question in an LLM. It's a new skill to learn: page optimisation for AI engines, how to get cited within trusted sources that AI engines rely on (hello PR), and how to engage with communities like Reddit.  
  
4. Creator-led Content Manager: The creator-led content manager builds and manages your team of creators (internal/external) to grow influence across your audience. Today, most B2B companies are set up to do traditional brand content. But, we're seeing people in B2B gravitate towards creators vs brands. A trend we saw many years ago, and it is the core reason we acquired TheHustle in 2021. Today, we generate more demand through these creator-led channels compared to traditional brand channels. Crazy! This trend is going to accelerate because of AI. People will want to consume content from people, not brands.  
  
5. Intent Signal Strategist: AI is a BOOM for intent signals. The Intent signal strategist ensures you take full advantage of them. They'll ensure you do that by being more proactive (reaching potential buyers before competitors) and creating tailored experiences for a smaller subset of your audience. You need an A+ player to uplevel how intent is used across your buying journey. We've seen upwards of 500% increase in conversion rates when combining intent signals with personalisation.

The role of a 'pure' manager is going to die in the next 5 years.  
  
Anyone who has lost vertical expertise, doesn't practice the craft, and instead only does horizontal oversight will be obsolete in 5 years.  
  
Elena has scaled some of the world's best tech companies and can see this trend firsthand after joining Lovable to lead growth.  
  
Horizontal managers add layers of friction, hold information hostage, and they've lost all vertical expertise.  
  
You truly gain a competitive advantage by maintaining your hands-on expertise while leading, creating an organization with more autonomy, where people can perform roles end-to-end and ship much faster.  
  
AI is a great time for people who love leading and practicing the craft.  
  
It's bad time for those who love the 'pure' management role.

Here's how AI can help run your marketing team. These are 7 of my go-to daily use cases. It took a lot of iteration to land on these exact use cases and tools.  
  
1. ChatGPT (GPT-5 / o3)  
  
a. AI Chief of Staff (Projects & Ops)  
  
- Replaces: Time spent on scattered comms  
- Outcome: Keeps me on top of metrics, blockers, and updates  
- How: Create a ChatGPT Project per critical project; add docs/updates; use “You are my AI Chief of Staff…” instructions.  
  
b. Executive/Board Update  
  
- Replaces: Deck wrangling & long status emails  
- Outcome: Turns raw notes/data into a clean exec-ready update  
- How: Paste metrics + notes; run “C-suite 2-pager” prompt; export to doc/slide (GenSpark - see below)  
  
c. Strategy Sparring (My red team)  
  
- Replaces: Echo-chamber reviews & blind-spot  
- Outcome: Surfaces blind spots and sharp counterpoints  
- How: In your ChatGPT Project, run: “Red-team this: [brief]. Return (1) top 5 counter-arguments (+ likely evidence), (2) hidden assumptions + how to test, (3) pre-mortem with early warning signals  
  
2. GenSpark (My deck designer)  
  
- Replaces: So MUCH time wasted on decks  
- Outcome: Turns rough drafts into polished decks FAST  
- How: I use ChatGPT to craft prompts, give them to GenSpark with my docs to turn into professional decks.  
  
3. Claude (My creative writing assistant)  
  
- Replaces: Staring at blank page  
- Outcome: Finds unique takes and strong points of view tailored for audience  
- How: Paste your audience profile + topic; prompt: “Generate 7 unique takes (ranked), 5 counterpoints with rebuttals, 3 punchy debate framings  
  
4. Lovable / Replit (Demo > Memo)  
  
- Replaces: Long memos & debate cycles  
- Outcome: Turns an idea into a working demo to share  
- How: In Lovable/Replit, paste a 5-line spec (user story + acceptance criteria) → generate app.  
  
5. NotebookLM (PDF/memo → Podcast)  
  
- Replaces: Long memo reading sessions  
- Outcome: Podcast-style overview + Q&A (actually fun / listen when walking)  
- How: Create a Notebook, add PDFs/memos, generate an audio overview; queue follow-up questions to spin extra episodes.  
  
6. xAI / Grok (ICP Content Research)  
  
- Replaces: Persona guesses & generic content calendars  
- Outcome: Reveals what content my audience actually consumes & shares  
- How: In Grok, feed ~20 ICP handles; “Analyze last 90 days: top topics, formats (thread/video/link), linked domains, engagement patterns, posting cadence; output 5 ‘make-this-next’ briefs.  
  
7. Veo3 (FUN!!!)  
  
- Replaces: Not being able to bring ideas to life via video  
- Outcome: FUN!. I love VEO3. Working to bring ideas to life. Stay tuned  
- How: Using ChatGPT as my creative assistant to write scripts for Veo3.  
  
A whole lot of AI!

I built this entire 'vibe marketing' workflow to replace myself.  
  
It took me 10 months to build.  
  
Now, when I add a LinkedIn post, it will spit back out a funny comment and automatically post it.  
  
Total vibes (and 100% not marketing automation).  
  
DM me - "Vibes" in the comments and I'll post it.

The big headline for marketers about AI -> traffic coming from these assistants converts WAY better than Google search. But it means there's a big shift we need to make to our marketing playbooks.  
  
Here are some of the top-line data points:  
  
- Ahrefs —> AI search visitors convert 23× better than traditional organic -  
- Semrush —> AI search visitors are 4.4× more valuable on average than Google organic.  
- Seer Interactive —> ChatGPT traffic converts at 15.9% vs. Google organic's 1.76% (~9× better).  
  
What's happening?  
  
This is great for marketers. By increasing our visibility in LLMs, we can drive far higher-converting traffic.  
  
The flip side is that the reason this traffic converts much better is that the entire research process is now happening in these AI assistants.  
  
They used to do all this research on your website, and then a small number converted. Now, they do all the research prior to visiting your website, and when they do, they're ready to buy.  
  
It means your website becomes a 'closer', you need to turn it into your best salesperson, you'll get less traffic and need to convert more of it. You'll do this via:  
  
- Conversational chat (driven by AI)  
- Multi-modal AI agents that are excellent sellers  
- Content tailored to selling  
  
The buyer journey is getting condensed into AI Search (research) -> Vendor website (closing).

With AI, how the F**K do you even do marketing anymore? If I had to build a plan from scratch today, here’s exactly what I’d do.  
  
1. AI Search  
  
What: Grow ‘share of voice’ in LLMs for transactional questions.  
How: Create LLM-optimized, niche-specific pages with citations  
Tools: xFunnel, [UserBear.ai](http://userbear.ai/), query-mapping LLMs  
Why: By 2027, 95% of B2B buyers' journeys will start on an LLM  
  
2. Master-Short Form Content  
  
What: Grow influence via text and video content using AI.  
How: Master written hooks and short-form storytelling to capture attention on LinkedIn & X & YouTube  
Tools: VEO3, Captions Mirage, Fine-Tuned LLMs for first drafts  
Why: 65% of B2B buyers prefer short-form content to learn about products/services  
  
3. Code-powered Experiences  
  
What: Create free tools or interactive content to acquire demand.  
How: Build shareable tools, agents and turn static content into interactive, product-led experiences.  
Tools: Claude Code, Lovable, Replit, [Agent.ai](http://agent.ai/)  
Why: 70% of B2B buyers prefer self-serve tools and interactive content  
  
4. Build an Intent Engine  
  
What: Build intent engine to meet buyers where they are  
How: Map internal and external intent signals to your ICP and optimize AI experiences for what converts.  
Tools: Depends on your ICP and data sources.  
Why: 93% of B2B marketers saw improved conversion rates when using intent signals.  
  
5. AI Sales Prospecting  
  
What: Automate SDR/BDR/Sales-rep prospecting with AI  
How: Automate personalized emails and call scripts to scale outbound and inbound sales  
Tools: HubSpot, HeyGen, intent data.  
Why: Reps spend only 28%-33% of time selling — AI boosts conversion + saves time.  
  
6. Micro-Audience Campaigns  
  
What: Hyper-targeted campaigns for micro-audiences using AI signals.  
How: Use intent signals to split your ICP into micro-audiences, then auto-generate and launch targeted AI-driven campaigns  
Tools: LLMs, Perplexity Labs, Agents  
Why: Targeted campaigns increase CTR by 209% and conversions by 3–5×.

How to write better LinkedIn posts with AI  
  
Step 1: Don't say "LinkedIn" anywhere in your prompt.  
  
First, I'm not advocating for using AI to create LinkedIn posts. AI is a great writing assistant. Not a tool to create and publish content.  
  
However, this tip offers an interesting approach to consider when using LLM models for writing.  
  
A significant portion of the content on LinkedIn sucks. That's what's in the LLM's training set, so it will attempt to give you content that sucks if asked for a "post for LinkedIn".  
  
Instead, consider micro-prompts for each part of your post vs. asking it to provide content for a specific platform e.g.  
  
Give the LLM your post idea + first draft and iterate on each part of the post with these kind of micro-prompts:  
  
"Give me a vivid, sensory-rich opening scene that places the reader in a moment of challenge I described in the post."  
  
"Create an internal monologue revealing the doubts and fears readers will have about this change."  
  
"Create a climactic moment where the outcome becomes clear"  
  
"Give me a clear and concise reflection on how this experience will change the reader, personally and professionally."  
  
Micro-prompts are a great way to iterate on all parts of your post and get great suggestions vs. creating one prompt to produce an entire post.
