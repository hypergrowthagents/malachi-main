i just watched a guy scrape google maps with an ai agent and show EXACTLY which boring businesses can make you stupid money in your local area  
  
not HVAC or plumbing...the local startup ideas NOBODY talks about  
  
how it works (save this)  
  
1/ a workflow that finds overlooked local niches like garage organizers and irrigation systems through google map's treasure chest of data  
  
2/ an agent that measures demand by tracking review volume and velocity in google maps  
  
3/ a system that turns customer complaints into newsletter content automatically  
  
4/ a workflow hosted on n8n for $7/month that runs nonstop and gets you concurrent workflows so dont hit a ceiling on workflows  
  
5/ a directory that sells leads back to service providers for $100–200 each  
  
6/ a process that scales to $20–30k/month with minimal overhead  
  
my friend james "the boring marketer", the vibe marketing guy, shared all the sauce with us. lots of people charge $10k for this sorta stuff, but we gave it away  
  
note: the full tutorial is below (or you can find it on youtube under my channel greg isenberg and the most recent vid)  
  
cool thing is james started a mobile diesel company in north carolina using this exact process that's making $30k/month so he knows it works  
  
what hit me is how obvious it felt.  
  
of course google maps has the gold  
  
just need AI to shovel it out.

OpenAI JUST released how people are using chatgpt  
  
each bar in this chart is a billion-dollar wedge if you build the right verticalized, trust-rich AI startup:  
  
1/ tutoring + teaching (10.2%) - people want on-demand teachers more than almost anything else. a personal ai tutor that explains things your way, remembers your progress, and nudges you daily.  
  
2/ how-to advice (8.5%) - this is consumer SaaS for micro-niches: “how to fix my resume,” “how to meal prep,” “how to set up my Shopify store.” every “how-to” is a wedge into a vertical AI agent.  
  
3/ personal writing + editing (18% combined) - 8% of traffic is people asking AI to write emails, 10.6% is editing or critiquing text. this is demand for AI copilots inside every workflow tool: sales, legal, HR, PR.  
  
4/ health, fitness, beauty, self-care (5.7%) - validated consumer wedge. people already trust AI with their bodies. AI trainers, AI nutritionists, AI skin coaches — with a human layer for accountability.  
  
5/ purchasable products (2.1%)- tiny % but huge monetization. people literally asking AI what to buy. the Amazon affiliate model gets reborn here. whoever builds the “AI-powered shopping layer” owns the new SEO.  
  
6/ translation (4.5%)still unsolved. what people want isn’t raw translation, it’s contextual translation: tone, culture, slang. AI that doesn’t just translate but localizes your intent.  
  
7/ computer programming (4.2%) - we know this, but it’s worth underlining: devs want copilots. the non-obvious play is vertical code copilots... Shopify dev copilot, Unreal Engine copilot, etc.  
  
TLDR;  
  
every bar is a behavior that people are already paying for elsewhere. translate those behaviors into vertical ai agents and startups.  
  
the data doesn't lie.

pretty crazy that people are vibe coding music now (this is dj_dave). she uses strudel a new live coding app to write music in your browser (open source too)  
  
i never knew this was possible before

this is exactly how i’d build wealth with a vertical ai agent startup (without raising VC $)  
  
step 1: find a boring pain point. something universal, hated, and expensive. think customs paperwork, insurance audits, compliance checklists. the less glamorous, the better.  
  
step 2: map the workflow. don’t brainstorm in a figma file, sit next to the person doing the work. write down every click, every exception, every “this is where it breaks.” the edge cases are the product. gotta be meticulous here.  
  
step 3: do the job as a service. literally run it yourself with a small team. invoice your first customers. this is where you’ll discover what really matters versus what the powerpoint version of the workflow looks like.  
  
step 4: start adding agents to replace the human steps. not all at once obviously, pick one slice of the workflow and automate it. free up hours, prove value, charge more. rinse and repeat until the workflow is mostly agent-driven.  
  
step 5: use the data you collect as the moat. every invoice, form, log, and exception makes your agent sharper. data → better models → stickier product.  
  
and step 0 to be honest, is i'm building an audience along the way. showing my work, sharing the playbook, pulling future customers and talent into my orbit before the product even exists. iterating on 50+ formats and probably doing short-form to start.  
  
the pattern looks the same every time for these types of vertical ai agent startups:  
  
human service → semi-automated service → vertical agent product.  
  
the goal of the agent goes from assisting in the workflow, to owning it.  
  
that’s when you stop being a tool and start being the infrastructure for that industry.  
  
once you own it, you're likely in vc competition territory. but you can compete if your unit economics are solid, audience is cranking and the product is loved.  
  
why build a vertical ai startup now? because the foundation models are good enough (and getting better), the costs are low enough, and the demand for efficiency is high enough.  
  
five years ago the tech wasn’t ready.  
five years from now the incumbents will be.  
  
the window is open right now.  
  
it's building season.

The more wealth I see created, the more I notice it happens when people can't STAND their reality anymore.  
  
Sometimes it's crisis like getting fired, divorced, diagnosed. But just as often it's that suffocating feeling of watching your potential die in meetings  
  
Making $300,000 at Google but knowing you're capable of building something that matters. Your life looks perfect on LinkedIn but you're screaming inside.  
  
Satisfied people don't usually start companies. They start companies when satisfaction becomes somehow unbearable.  
  
When you realize you're going to be 40, then 50, then dead, and all you did was optimize someone else's conversion rates and most of the stuff you worked on never got shipped anyways.  
  
That's when you quit the job and build the thing you've been sketching in notebooks during meetings. Not because something bad happened, but because "pretty good" is killing you slowly.  
  
Sometimes rock bottom pushes you. Sometimes the ceiling pulls you. Either way, the discomfort with where you are becomes stronger than the fear of where you're going.  
  
I remember the restfulness I felt when I worked as a PM at a big tech company. Life was great. Felt important because I was doing things "at scale". Pay was insane. People I'd meet at parties thought my job was cool.  
  
But deep down had restfulness. Whenever that happens, gotta tap into it.  
  
It's your intuition saying there's something more there.  
  
its your intuition saying "now's the time"  
  
This AI gold rush won't last forever.  
  
Happy building, my friend.

Once you ship your first idea on the internet, it rewires your brain.  
  
You go from consumer to creator. You see the matrix now.  
  
The first time you wake up to Stripe notifications from strangers buying something you built on a weekend, you're done. You'll be sitting in quarterly planning meetings, but all you can think about is the $29 that just hit your account during slide 14.  
  
That's when you know you're cookeddd.  
  
Customer DMs hit different than performance reviews. Some kid in Poland says you saved him 10 hours a week. Someone in Texas shows you how your thing doubled their revenue. Meanwhile, your manager wants to discuss your professional development plan.  
  
You start seeing how broken everything is. Your company spends $50k on consultants to solve what you fixed with a spreadsheet. Fifteen people in meetings about problems you solved on Saturday night.  
  
Every product you ship teaches you something. First ten products: mostly garbage, but you're learning. By product twenty, you finally crack distribution. By product thirty, you're dangerous. You build in hours what companies discuss for months.  
  
The compound effect is real but slow. You might ship 19 things that nobody sees. Number 20 randomly hits. Then you reverse engineer why and repeat it. Most people quit at product 3. The unemployable ones can't stop at 30.  
  
Once you've tasted building for your own audience, employment feels like a costume you wear. You can't unknow what you know. Can't unsee the opportunity. Can't go back to asking permission.  
  
Pick the smallest problem in your life this weekend. Build the dumbest solution. Charge money for it.  
  
Most people die with ideas inside them. You're going to die with shipped products and an audience that remembers you.  
  
AI makes it so anyone is a founder if you want it.  
  
If you made it this far, I'm rooting for you.  
  
You're an unemployable founder.

My 1 pager on what you need to know about today's OpenAI's gpt-oss announcement  
  
OpenAI just made it possible to build AI for healthcare, finance, defense etc. The $300B+ markets that were off-limits are now wide open.  
  
The Announcement  
  
- OpenAI released gpt-oss - open-weights reasoning models you can run locally  
- 120B version matches o3 performance, smaller versions run on phones  
- Completely free, download today  
- Result of billions in R&D  
  
What This Actually Means  
  
- No more API costs - one-time hardware investment  
- No data leaves your device - privacy by default  
- Works offline - no internet required  
- You can modify the model itself - not just prompts  
  
Industries That Can Finally Use AI  
  
- Healthcare: HIPAA-compliant apps, medical diagnosis, therapy tools  
- Finance: Trading systems, fraud detection, private wealth management  
- Legal: Contract analysis, case research with full confidentiality  
- Government/Defense: Classified document processing, field intelligence  
  
The Biggest Opportunities  
  
- Regulated Industries - $300B healthcare market now accessible  
- Offline Markets - 4 billion people with phones but poor internet  
- Enterprise Privacy - Air-gapped systems, proprietary data  
- Edge Computing - Instant responses, no network delays  
- Model Tools - Everyone needs deployment, optimization, fine-tuning  
  
Why This Is Different  
  
- Previous: Pay per API call forever  
- Now: Pay once for hardware, infinite usage  
- Previous: Build around rate limits  
- Now: Build assuming unlimited compute  
  
Business Model Shifts  
  
- Sell apps instead of  subscriptions  
- One-time purchases at premium prices  
- Enterprise licenses without ongoing costs  
  
What Builders Should Do Now  
  
- Pick one regulated/offline/privacy-sensitive vertical  
- Price high - you're selling capability, not API access  
- Smart builders will own entire industries that couldn't use cloud AI

The CLEAREST path to $5m ARR AI startup is something nobody talks about on LinkedIn/X, is BORING and requires 0 venture investors.  
  
it's called a leveraged agency. & i'm gonna show you exactly how to build one.  
  
Phase 1: learn by doing ($1-5k/month)  
  
find a b2b/prosumer problem so boring it makes people want to die. insurance forms. invoice processing. review responses.  
  
the more soul-crushing, the better.  
  
now here's where everyone mess up up: they rush to build software.  
  
slow down, cowboy. we'll get there.  
  
you do it MANUALLY. like a caveman. $2k/month to be someone's human copy-paste machine.  
  
your friends raising seed rounds will think you've lost it. they're building "the future." you're copying data from PDFs. they'll feel bad for you, and you'll probably feel bad for yourself too.  
  
but when you do the work manually, you learn what NO customer interview will teach you. which fields actually matter. what breaks everything. what clients say they want vs what they'll actually pay for.  
  
YOU EARN THE INSIGHT.  
  
six months of this. pure pain. pure learning.  
  
Phase 2: Build the Machine ($5-25k/month)  
  
month 7 hits different.  
  
you've seen every edge case. every stupid request. every way a human breaks the process.  
  
NOW you build. not a product. a SYSTEM.  
  
AI agents are your new employees.  
  
you're duct-taping AI agents together to do EXACTLY what you were doing manually. and better.  
  
you dont need to reinvent an agent platform.  
  
here's the beautiful part... you keep charging the SAME price.  
  
client doesn't care HOW you do it. they care that it's DONE.  
  
your margins just went from 40% to 80%. you handle 50 clients instead of 5.  
  
you keep costs low, begin using agents to fulfill some of the work.  
  
Phase 3: Package the Magic ($25k+/month)  
  
time to segment, you add new pricing tiers.  
  
Enterprise: $8k/month. white glove everything.  
Self-serve: $500/month. here's your login, figure it out.  
API: $99/month. for the nerds.  
  
same backend. different prices. pure profit.  
  
watch this: "we use AI to revolutionize workflows" → crickets.  
  
"we process your forms in 24 hours with 99.9% accuracy" → SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY.  
  
"BuT yoU mAkE it SouNd sO EaSY. HoW to gEt CuStoMers"  
  
every week, solve ONE problem in public:  
  
"client had 47 customs delays. built this tracker. saved $80k. here's the exact template."  
  
give it ALL away.  
  
1000 people see it → 100 save it → 10 try it → 1 succeeds → 9 become customers.  
  
you put paid ads behind the organic stuff that is working.  
  
that 1 person tells everyone you gave away the secret sauce. the 9 who failed? they pay you $3k/month because doing it themselves is harder than it looks  
  
you can find a bunch of these ideas at [ideabrowser.com](http://ideabrowser.com/) (also can check community signals feature for painpoints from linkedin, fb groups, reddit)  
  
find boring problem → do it manually → build AI agents to replace yourself → charge service prices for automated work  
  
highest probability path to $5M ARR for an AI startup in 2025.

Y Combinator JUST announced what startups they want to fund next in 2025. And they want 10-person companies worth $100 billion (and more).  
  
My notes below in case it's helpful to you:  
  
1. AI-Powered Vocational Training  
The Problem: AI infrastructure needs skilled tradespeople (electricians, welders, HVAC techs), but training takes years The Opportunity: Use multimodal AI, AR/VR to train workers in months, not years Revenue Model: Employers pay for well-trained workers; AI teachers scale infinitely  
  
2. Video Generation as Computing Primitive  
The Reality: Google's Veo 3 creates photorealistic 8-second clips for dollars; costs approaching $0 Applications:  
Personalized content (TikTok for one viewer, canceled TV show revivals)  
Commerce (try-on experiences, auto-staged apartments)  
Gaming (no game engines needed, infinite robotic training data) Focus: Build infrastructure for limitless, low-latency video  
  
3. The 10-Person, $100B Company  
The Shift: Like cloud computing 15 years ago, AI eliminates need for large teams Key Metric: Revenue per employee becomes critical optimization target Advantages: No politics, fewer meetings, faster execution vs. bloated incumbents Goal: $100B company with just $500K in YC funding  
  
4. Multi-Agent System Infrastructure  
Evolution: AI agents moving from single-threaded to distributed workflows with thousands of sub-agents Challenges: Traditional distributed systems problems plus new issues (prompt engineering, monitoring, untrusted context) Opportunity: Make operating agent fleets as routine as deploying web services  
  
5. AI-Native Enterprise Software  
Historical Pattern: Salesforce & ServiceNow (both $10B+ revenue, $200B+ market cap) rode cloud wave 25 years ago to beat incumbents Today's Opportunity: AI presents same once-in-generation chance Vision: "Cursor for sales, HR, and accounting" - AI embedded throughout, not just system of record Advantage: Incumbents will struggle to rebuild around AI  
  
6. Replacing Government Consulting with LLMs  
Market Size: US government spends $100B+ annually on consulting (Deloitte, Accenture) Drivers: Political pressure to cut waste, LLMs can already do consulting work Examples: FedRAMP approval automation, regulation compliance checking Opportunity: Build LLM software to replace traditional consulting functions  
  
What YC Wants: Deep domain expertise in specific verticals, Full automation, not just human assistance, Clear B2B revenue paths, Infrastructure/tools that help AI scale, Treating AI as primitive building block  
  
Happy building.
