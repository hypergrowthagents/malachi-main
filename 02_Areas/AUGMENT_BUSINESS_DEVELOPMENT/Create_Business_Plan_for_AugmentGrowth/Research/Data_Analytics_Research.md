---

## Executive Summary

Research reveals critical inefficiencies in data analytics workflows for growth companies:
- Data professionals spend 82% of time on data preparation vs. 18% on actual analysis
- 70% of generative AI projects remain trapped in experimental phases without business impact
- Average enterprise runs 900 applications with only one-third properly integrated
- Finance departments spend 520+ hours annually on manual tasks that could be automated

Key insight: The fundamental imbalance between data preparation and analysis time represents a critical inefficiency that AI can address systematically, yet most companies lack the capabilities to implement effectively.

# AI Implementation Challenges in Data Analytics and Reporting Workflows for Series A-C Growth Companies

Series A through C growth companies face a unique convergence of challenges as they scale their operations while simultaneously attempting to implement artificial intelligence solutions in their data analytics and reporting workflows. Research indicates that these organizations spend disproportionate amounts of time on manual reporting processes, with data analysts dedicating less than 20% of their time to actual analysis while 82% is consumed by data preparation, management, and governance activities[22]. This fundamental imbalance becomes particularly acute for growth-stage companies that must demonstrate clear metrics to investors while managing increasingly complex data ecosystems. The implementation of AI solutions promises to address these inefficiencies, yet introduces new complexities around data integration, attribution modeling, and dashboard optimization that can significantly impact a company's ability to scale effectively and maintain competitive advantage in rapidly evolving markets.
