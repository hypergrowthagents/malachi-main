## 8. Detailed Interview Q&A

### Strategic Context Questions

**Q1a: Market positioning - Who are your closest competitors and why does this market gap exist?**

**A1a:** Short, medium, and long-term visions are important to separate. Short-term: Me as consultant/agency of one with packaged offerings supported by background agents. Medium-term: Scale to team with other growth experts and technical resources, becoming AI-first agency. Long-term: Self-serve agent platform with full automation.

Short-term competitors: Growth advisors, fractional growth leaders, agencies doing this work. Could position as "one-man army" capable of many things, making it simpler for companies needing growth services + AI elevation. Go Marble as AI-driven performance marketing competitor. Alternative is companies hiring internally for AI+growth combination.

**A1b:** Market gap exists because technology is new - people still figuring it out. Divide between what AI agents can do today (simple, low-level steps, linear workflows) vs. what they're not good at (complicated needs). Skills gap where you need to really know how to utilize AI systems to get expected output. Agencies focus on technical pieces - integration, workflows - but not well-aligned to specific problems or output needs. My goal: solve generic agents by creating richer inputs, contexts, goals, and own the outcome through review/refinement until production-ready.

**Q2a: Customer segment - Company size focus and buyer dynamics?**

**A2a:** Probably smaller companies not ready for 5 different agencies. Hyper-growth, early-stage startups need everything and value someone in trenches holding their hand - consulting + operations + execution + strategy. Don't know if big companies would want this specifically, but could be useful as advisor or help install capabilities.

**A2b:** Seed/Series A: CEO or COO decision makers. Series B: Head of Growth that I'm supplementing. Series C+: VP or CMO. VCs/advisors as referral sources (gatekeepers, not decision makers).

Budget: Companies have budget for growth initiatives more than tooling/automation. Tooling is commoditized, they want cheap. But if you deliver growth outcome efficiently, there's big budgets. Need 90-day ROI with 30-day proof that you're on path. Don't think companies invest in unclear ROI automation that takes 6-12 months.

Current alternatives: Mix of trying to own growth + AI internally while hiring freelancers and legacy agencies for operations. No existing business like AugmentGrowth offering both together meaningfully.

**Q3a: Service delivery - Engagement structure and scaling?**

**A3a:** Leaning towards monthly retainers ($10K/month target) for revenue predictability. Give options for how to use it - strategy + various services delivered by me or agents. Focus initially on building agents that support me, make me move faster, plus teach their team AI workflows. Option to build capabilities into their systems as handoff, but most people are busy and want someone else to own outcome.

**A3b:** 3-5 companies sounds right for starting. If $10K/month retainers and need $10K+ to make sense, probably want 3-4 clients. More than that, hiring others = medium-term approach.

Hardest to systematize: Ongoing optimization when agents break due to model changes or very customized client needs. Technical implementation isn't hard part - hard part is hand-holding client, extracting knowledge, developing custom AI process for their system. Don't want to get into custom versions because not scalable.

**A3c:** Monthly retainer $10K/month target, 3 clients = $30K/month with upside. Open to different pricing models initially. Value-based/outcome-based pricing option but can't guarantee specific growth results until proven system. Might offer discounted pricing + money-back guarantee for first clients to reduce risk while learning.

**Q4a: Technical moat beyond Claude Code SDK?**

**A4a:** Combination of rich context approach and human-in-the-loop. Quality of people with deep growth expertise guiding systems. Agencies could replicate because they have talent. Agent architecture has no moat - anybody can build/copy.

**Q4b: Which growth disciplines are biggest advantages?**

**A4b:** Probably paid acquisition and experimentation are biggest moats, maybe data analytics to some extent and how it connects with other pieces.

**Q4c: Network strength and distribution strategy?**

**A4c:** Strength is okay. Worked with many people, could reach out for referrals. Coastline, A16Z touchpoints. Not huge network but not starting from zero. 100% content/thought leadership as key channel plus mining network. Hypothesis: If reach out to 200 people in network and can't move needle, poor product-market fit - shouldn't expand to cold audiences.

**Q4d: Competitive response timeline?**

**A4d:** Inevitable that traditional agencies add AI capabilities. Want to be AI-first solution, newcomer backed by growth experience. Difference: Traditional agencies have organizational bloat affecting margins. Design something with none of that to compete efficiently. Larger players would need expensive pivot. Have speed and first-to-market advantage - can do it fast and inexpensively while they work out how to do it.

### Follow-up Questions

**Q: Packaged offerings clarification?**

**A:** Built agent/framework that enables faster output delivery. Example: AI-generated content videos with workflow leveraging ICP research → prompts → images → VAIO3 videos. Sell based on cost per video or monthly video count. Another example: Daily/weekly meta and Google alerts flowing into Slack via N8N. Building capability in agent/workflow form, then selling that capability. Might deliver faster, better, or cheaper than existing solutions.

**Q: Technical resources vs. growth experts for scaling?**

**A:** Technical resources first to scale agent capabilities. Then add growth experts to replace me as interface or help create specialized agents. Could tap experts in various disciplines with compensation structure - they provide step-by-step workflow details, help build it, then rev-share or fixed fee when sold.

**Q: Rich context vs. competitors' approach example?**

**A:** Every agent I've seen goes right into execution fast - "Give me URL, I'll crank out 100 ads." That's spray and pray, why AI quality isn't super high. My version: Know exactly what I need upfront. Company fills questionnaire, upload brand style guides, pull together deep research on them and competitors. Set up important inputs so agent knows everything about company, goals, customers, monetization to develop robust outputs.
