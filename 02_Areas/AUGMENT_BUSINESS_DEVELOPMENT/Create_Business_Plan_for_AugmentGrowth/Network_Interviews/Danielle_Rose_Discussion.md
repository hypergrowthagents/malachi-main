- Decisions we need to make today	
- Blockers and risks discussion	
- What's realistic and what's not with the model? Where might it make sense to be more aggressive or conservative	
- Goal: By 8 weeks, money is flowing in in some capacity, whether via consulting or agents	
- Spend a significant amount of time reaching out to my network about this. Do that every day bite size. Start nurturing my network	
- Lean into AI uses where I'm already most strong and comfortable	
- Thinks the idea of a human being superpowered by AI is going to be more attractive by AI. Talk about how I built all of these agents and I can run them all and can do the work of 5 people, but I'm able to do this all by being augmented by AI here. This seems like a smart starting point.	
	- The system is only as good as the person sold with it.
