### Market Dynamics & Competition

- Growing faster than any other MMP despite mature market
    
- AppsFlyer still dominant but will match pricing when threatened
    
- AppLovin trying to sell Adjust (shrinking but still $120M+ ARR)
    
- Branch/Tune fading from major discussions
    
- Market shifting toward operational layer rather than just attribution
    

### AI Integration Feedback

- LLMs will likely eat most applications built on top of them
    
- Defensibility requires unique functionality or datasets
    
- Big need for giving companies AI starting points they can customize to fit their own needs
    
- Agrees with thesis: LLMs poorly trained on growth examples, won’t excel naturally
    
- Integration challenges major barrier for agent platforms
    
    - Ex. Built translation layer for Singular MCP integration
        
    - Requires engineering resources, not plug-and-play APIs
        

### Enterprise AI Adoption Reality

- AI adoption “embarrassingly slow” among large customers
    
- IT restrictions limiting tool access (Gemini-only, Copilot-only mandates)
    
- Companies know they need AI but uncertain what’s approved
    
- Fewer requests for growth consultant recommendations recently
    

### Next Steps

- Continue dialogue on AI growth platform concept validation
    
- Malachirose to share pitch snippet for feedback on viability
    
- Multiple approach flavors still being evaluated (fractional vs agent platform focus)
