## Prompt for Claude Desktop

```
I need you to help me create a comprehensive financial model Excel workbook for my startup, AugmentGrowth. I'm building a "Growth Executive AI" platform providing specialized AI agents with strategic orchestration for Series A-C companies.

**CONTEXT FILES TO REFERENCE:**
Please ask me to upload these key files so you can understand the business context:
1. AugmentGrowth_Vision_Draft_2025-09-16.md (business model and positioning)
2. Any screenshots or files of my finances I have

**BUSINESS MODEL OVERVIEW:**
- Service: AI agent platform + strategic orchestration for growth marketing
- Target: Series A-C companies (10-200 employees, $1M-50M ARR)
- Pricing: $10K/month retainer model ($8K-15K range); need to evaluate other scenarios with lower starting price points too
- Capacity: Starting with 3-4 foundational clients
- Goal: $25K MRR within 3 months

**FINANCIAL MODEL REQUIREMENTS:**

**Tab 1: Personal Financial Dashboard**
- Current cash position (I'll provide account balances)
- Monthly personal expenses and burn rate
- Personal runway calculations
- Break-even scenarios

**Tab 2: Business Revenue Model**
- Monthly progression projections (conservative, base, optimistic)
- Client acquisition timeline and scenarios
- Pricing strategy analysis
- Revenue milestones and decision points

**Tab 3: Cost Structure & Operations**
- Startup costs breakdown
- Monthly operating expenses
- Customer acquisition costs
- Scale-based cost modeling

**Tab 4: Cash Flow & Runway**
- Combined personal + business cash flow
- Funding requirements analysis
- Break-even timeline scenarios
- Decision milestone framework

**Tab 5: Scenario Planning**
- Best/worst/most likely case modeling
- Sensitivity analysis for key variables
- Decision trees for business pivots
- Risk mitigation planning

**BEFORE YOU START BUILDING:**
Please ask me specific questions to gather:

1. **Personal Financial Inputs:**
   - Current liquid cash across all accounts
   - Monthly personal expenses (housing, food, insurance, etc.)
   - Any existing income sources
   - Financial runway without business income

2. **Business Assumptions:**
   - Client acquisition timeline expectations
   - Marketing/sales investment capacity
   - Operational tool costs and requirements
   - Legal/administrative setup costs

3. **Risk Tolerance & Scenarios:**
   - Conservative vs aggressive growth assumptions
   - Funding timeline constraints
   - Personal financial minimum requirements
   - Business pivot thresholds

4. **Success Metrics:**
   - Key performance indicators to track
   - Financial milestones for business decisions
   - Personal financial goals and timelines

Once you have this information, create a dynamic Excel model with charts, scenario toggles, and clear visualizations that I can use for investor conversations and personal planning.

Make this a professional-grade financial model that could be shared with potential investors or advisors while helping me make informed decisions about personal financial risk and business development priorities.
