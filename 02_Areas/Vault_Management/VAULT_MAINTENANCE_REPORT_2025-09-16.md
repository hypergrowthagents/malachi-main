## Major Reorganization: Content Creation Project â†’ Content Production System

### Executive Summary
Successfully executed PARA method reorganization by moving Content Creation from Projects to Areas, reflecting its true nature as an ongoing content production system rather than a finite project.

### Organizational Changes

#### Files Moved
- **Source**: `01_Projects/Content_Creation/` (entire folder)
- **Destination**: `02_Areas/Content_and_Brand/Content_Production/`
- **Rationale**: Content creation is an ongoing operational system, not a project with an end date

#### Files Renamed
- `Content_Creation_Project_Summary.md` â†’ `Content_Production_System.md`
  - **Location**: Moved to `02_Areas/Content_and_Brand/Content_Production_System.md`
  - **Content Updated**: Changed from project-focused to system-focused language
  - **Tags Updated**: `#active-project` â†’ `#ongoing-area`, added `#content-system`, `#content-production`

#### Folder Structure Created
```
