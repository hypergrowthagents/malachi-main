# Owner.com Opportunity Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** #in-progress
**Related:** [[Owner.com - Wyatt Ozmore]], [[Service_Offerings_v6.1]]

---

## Company Profile vs. Current Positioning

### Owner.com Reality
- **Stage:** Series C (not Seed/Series A)
- **Ad Spend:** $1M+ quarterly ($333K+ monthly) - 2-7x our target range
- **Market:** B2B SaaS selling to restaurants (not consumer subscription apps)
- **Leadership:** CMO in place (Wyatt, 2 months in from Houzz)
- **Hiring Need:** Head of Growth Marketing (not fractional CMO/growth leader)
- **Team Status:** Existing team with changes coming by Dec 1st
- **PMF:** "Insane" triple-digit dollar retention

### Our Current Positioning (v6.1)
- **Stage:** Seed to Series A ($3-8M raised)
- **Ad Spend:** $50K-200K monthly
- **Market:** Consumer subscription apps (AI/SaaS, Fintech, Education)
- **Buyer:** CEO/COO with no growth leader OR growth leader needing support
- **Value Prop:** Replace 5-person growth team ($650K) with fractional leader

---

## Fit Analysis

### ✅ Strong Alignment

**1. AI Integration Priority**
- They want "AI integration across all functions"
- Our AI-Native Growth Operations is differentiated capability
- Could accelerate their team's AI adoption

**2. Channel Expansion Expertise**
- Need to de-risk Meta dependency (<50% leads by EOY)
- Testing YouTube, CTV, direct mail - need validation expertise
- Our "prove new channels" positioning fits perfectly

**3. Meta Creative Acceleration**
- Spending $333K+/month, need creative velocity
- Our AI creative generation (10-20 variants/week) aligns
- Creative performance analysis capability directly addresses need

**4. Experimentation Mindset**
- Wyatt wants "starter project/experiment approach"
- Our systematic testing and pattern library approach fits
- Attribution analysis capability addresses their challenges

**5. Speed & Execution**
- Series C with aggressive growth targets (2x October vs. previous best)
- Our 3x faster execution through AI aligns with pace needs
- 48-hour test cycles vs. 2-week agency timelines matches need

### ❌ Key Mismatches

**1. Strategic Leadership Overlap**
- Module 1 (Growth Leader) overlaps with Wyatt's CMO role
- Don't need fractional growth strategy - Wyatt owns that
- Need execution specialist, not strategic leader

**2. Market Positioning**
- Positioned for consumer subscription apps
- Owner.com is B2B SaaS (restaurant vertical)
- Restaurant audience fundamentally different buying behavior

**3. Company Stage**
- Positioned for Seed/Series A with growth uncertainty
- They're Series C with proven PMF and scaling challenges
- Different sophistication level and resource availability

**4. Spend Scale**
- Our pricing model: 10% of spend minimum $5K
- At $333K monthly spend = $33K/month for Module 2 alone
- This is 2x our combined module target pricing ($15-20K total)

**5. Team Context**
- Our pitch: "Can't afford $650K team"
- They have team, have budget, need specific expertise
- Looking for Head of Growth, not team replacement

---

## Opportunity Scope: What They Actually Need

### Primary Needs (Based on Meeting Notes)

**1. Channel Diversification Strategy & Execution**
- **Problem:** >50% leads from Meta, need to de-risk
- **Channels to Prove:** YouTube (geo-test mid-Nov), CTV (testing with Brett), Direct Mail (showing promise)
- **Our Fit:** Channel validation expertise, systematic testing, AI-powered analysis
- **Gap:** Attribution modeling for multi-channel (they mentioned this challenge)

**2. Meta Creative Acceleration**
- **Problem:** Need to scale Meta while diversifying (2x growth in October)
- **Current State:** $333K+ monthly spend, working well but need velocity
- **Our Fit:** AI creative generation, performance analysis, testing roadmap
- **Value:** 10-20 variants/week vs. manual creative production

**3. Attribution & Analytics Sophistication**
- **Problem:** "Attribution challenges" mentioned for YouTube
- **Need:** Cross-channel attribution, channel interaction effects
- **Our Fit:** Analytics & Insights capabilities (Module 2 advanced features)
- **Gap:** Enterprise-level attribution modeling may be beyond our scope

**4. AI Team Enablement**
- **Context:** "Focus on AI integration across all functions"
- **Opportunity:** Transfer AI-native growth capabilities to their team
- **Our Fit:** AI-Native Growth Operations training and SOPs
- **Value:** Permanent capability building, not dependency creation

### Secondary Considerations

**5. Fractional-to-Full-Time Path**
- Wyatt mentioned "open to fractional arrangements leading to full-time"
- Could position as "Head of Growth Marketing" trial before full hire
- De-risks their hiring decision with immediate value delivery

**6. Team Transition Management**
- "Potential team changes between now and December 1st"
- Continuity during transition could be valuable
- Fractional provides flexibility during restructuring

---

## What Would Need to Change: Adaptation Options

### Option A: Custom Scope for Owner.com (Don't Change Core Offering)

**Positioning:** Channel Expansion Specialist + Meta Acceleration

**Scope:**
1. **New Channel Validation** (YouTube, CTV, Direct Mail)
   - Systematic testing framework for each channel
   - Attribution modeling and incrementality analysis
   - Launch roadmap with clear success metrics
   - AI-powered competitive research and creative analysis

2. **Meta Creative Acceleration**
   - AI creative generation: 20-30 variants/week (scale for their spend)
   - Performance analysis and pattern discovery
   - Testing roadmap optimization
   - Creative intelligence reporting

3. **AI Team Enablement** (Simplified from Module 1)
   - Transfer AI workflows to Wyatt's team
   - SOPs for AI-powered growth processes
   - Tool stack recommendations and training
   - Pattern library documentation (learnings they own)

**Pricing Structure:**
- **Fixed Monthly:** $25-30K/month (reflects Series C scale and scope)
- **OR Hybrid:** $15K fixed + 3% of incremental spend on new channels
- **Duration:** 3-6 month engagement with extension options

**Rationale:** Keep core offering Seed/Series A focused, handle Series C as custom enterprise deals

---

### Option B: Create "Scale-Stage" Offering Tier

**New Tier:** Series B/C Channel Expansion & Acceleration

**Target Profile:**
- Series B/C companies with $200K+ monthly ad spend
- CMO or VP Growth in place (not looking for strategic leadership)
- Need channel diversification and execution velocity
- 1-2 proven channels, need to de-risk and expand

**Service Modules (Adapted):**

**Module 1S: Channel Expansion Leadership** ($20K/month)
- New channel validation and testing (2-3 channels simultaneously)
- Systematic experimentation framework
- Attribution and incrementality analysis
- Monthly strategic channel review with CMO
- AI team enablement and capability transfer

**Module 2S: Performance Acceleration** (5% of spend, $15K minimum)
- Scale pricing: Lower % for higher spend levels
- Creative acceleration (20-30 variants/week for scale budgets)
- Advanced analytics (attribution, LTV modeling, profit optimization)
- Daily optimization across all active channels
- Competitive intelligence and market analysis

**Target Pricing:** $35-50K/month for companies with $300K+ spend

**Rationale:** Create separate offering tier to capture later-stage market without diluting Seed/Series A positioning

---

### Option C: Modular Components for Custom Assembly

**Keep Core Offering Unchanged, Offer À La Carte Services:**

**Standalone Services:**
1. **Channel Validation Sprint** ($15K one-time + $8K/month for 3 months)
   - Validate 1 new channel with systematic testing
   - Attribution framework and success metrics
   - 90-day test with go/no-go recommendation

2. **Meta Creative Acceleration** ($12-15K/month standalone)
   - AI creative generation scaled to spend level
   - Performance analysis and optimization
   - Testing roadmap and pattern discovery

3. **AI Growth Enablement** ($20K one-time setup + $5K/month for 6 months)
   - Full AI-Native Growth Operations implementation
   - Team training and capability transfer
   - Ongoing support and quarterly refreshes

**Rationale:** Maximum flexibility, can mix and match based on client needs, doesn't require repositioning core offering

---

## Strategic Questions for Business Partner Evaluation

### Market Expansion vs. Focus Trade-offs

**1. Should we expand TAM to include Series B/C companies?**
- **Pro:** Larger deal sizes ($30-50K vs $15-20K), more budget flexibility
- **Con:** Different buying process, longer sales cycles, existing relationships with agencies
- **Risk:** Positioning confusion - "who are you actually for?"

**2. Is Owner.com an outlier or a pattern?**
- **Consider:** How many Series B/C intros do we get?
- **Question:** Is this a one-off opportunity or repeatable segment?
- **Data Point:** Brett Browman intro suggests there may be more in his network

**3. What's the positioning risk of serving both markets?**
- **Seed/Series A:** "Can't afford team, need everything, move fast"
- **Series B/C:** "Have team, have budget, need specialist expertise"
- **Conflict:** These are fundamentally different value propositions

**4. Can we serve both without brand dilution?**
- **Option:** Two separate offerings under same brand
- **Option:** Same brand, custom enterprise deals for Series B/C
- **Option:** Stay focused on Seed/Series A, refer out Series B/C

### Pricing & Positioning Implications

**5. Is $33K/month (10% of their spend) appropriate for Owner.com?**
- **Market Check:** What do Series C companies pay for growth consultants?
- **Value Alignment:** Does our delivery justify premium pricing at scale?
- **Competitor Benchmark:** What do agencies charge for this scope?

**6. Should we cap Module 2 pricing at certain spend levels?**
- **Current Model:** Unlimited 10% scaling
- **Alternative:** Tiered (10% up to $100K, 7% for $100-200K, 5% for $200K+)
- **Rationale:** Economies of scale in delivery, competitive positioning

### Execution Capabilities

**7. Can we actually deliver for Series C complexity?**
- **Attribution modeling:** Do we have expertise for multi-channel attribution?
- **Scale requirements:** Can we handle $333K+ monthly spend optimization?
- **Stakeholder management:** Series C means more stakeholders, approvals, processes

**8. Does this require different operational model?**
- **Team support:** Might need specialized contractors for advanced analytics
- **Tool stack:** Enterprise-level attribution and analytics tools
- **Process:** More formal reporting, stakeholder management

## Cross-Company Pain Point Analysis: What We Can Learn

### Comparing Owner.com (Series C) vs. DMS (PE-Backed) vs. Our Target ICP (Seed/Series A)

**Purpose:** Identify universal pain points that exist across company stages that we should emphasize in our core Seed/Series A offering WITHOUT changing ICP.

---

### Universal Pain Point #1: **Channel Expansion & De-Risking**

**Owner.com (Series C):**
- >50% leads from Meta, need to de-risk
- Testing YouTube, CTV, Direct Mail but need systematic validation
- **Pain:** Attribution challenges, don't know if new channels will scale

**DMS (PE-Backed):**
- Entirely manual media buying, no optimization
- Operating at <10% owned traffic vs. 50-80% industry benchmarks
- **Pain:** No framework for growing owned channels, all purchased traffic

**Seed/Series A Reality:**
- Often over-dependent on 1-2 channels (usually Meta + organic)
- Need to prove additional channels before Series A raise
- **Pain:** Can't afford to waste money testing channels that won't work

**✅ Insight for Our Offering:**
"Channel de-risking" is a UNIVERSAL pain point across all stages
- Seed/Series A companies are often over-indexed on Meta (same dependency issue)
- Current v6.1 mentions this for Growth Leaders but could be more prominent
- **Should strengthen:** Add explicit "Channel Dependency Risk" problem statement

**Recommended Change:**
Add standalone problem to v6.1 "Problems I Solve" section:
```markdown
### **Channel Dependency Risk**
- Over-dependent on 1-2 channels (usually Meta + organic)
- Need to prove new channels before Series A raise
- Can't afford to waste budget testing channels that won't scale
- Attribution challenges make it hard to prove ROI on brand/awareness channels
- Traditional agencies want 6-month commitments before testing (too risky)
```

---

### Universal Pain Point #2: **AI Implementation Gap (The "How" Problem)**

**Owner.com (Series C):**
- "Focus on AI integration across all functions"
- Want AI capabilities but don't know where to start or how to implement
- **Pain:** Everyone knows AI should help, no one knows HOW to use it effectively

**DMS (PE-Backed):**
- "AI integration essential for modern performance marketing"
- Vision for "soup-to-nuts" AI approach but currently all manual
- **Pain:** Need to rebuild entire growth operation with AI from ground up
- **Specifically wanted:** "Claude Code rollout across team" and "equip team to leverage AI in daily workflows"

**Seed/Series A Reality:**
- See competitors moving faster with AI, feel behind
- Try AI tools but outputs are generic ("AI slop")
- **Pain:** Team doesn't have bandwidth to learn while executing daily operations

**✅ Current v6.1 Coverage:**
We already address this well in "AI Implementation Gap" section
Our "AI-Native Growth Operations" section covers team enablement

**What DMS/Owner.com Teach Us:**
🔥 The "equip team to leverage AI in daily workflows" language from DMS is PERFECT
- This is clearer than "AI capability transfer"
- More tangible than "knowledge transfer, not automation implementation"

**Recommended Changes:**

1. **Change opening paragraph (v6.1 line 133):**
```markdown
I equip you and your core team (2-3 people) to leverage AI in daily workflows—giving them powerful tools and knowledge to solve growth problems independently.
```

2. **Add to Individual Setup:**
```markdown
- Ongoing coaching and capability building (not one-time training dump)
- Live training: Watch me solve real growth problems with AI, then practice on yours
```

3. **Rename section:**
Change "AI Capability Building" to "AI Team Enablement" (more active, clearer)

---

### Universal Pain Point #3: **Creative Velocity & Testing Framework**

**Owner.com (Series C):**
- Spending $333K+/month on Meta, need creative acceleration
- **Pain:** Traditional creative production too slow for scale testing needs

**DMS (PE-Backed):**
- Manual creative processes, no systematic testing
- **Pain:** No creative testing frameworks, no optimization between creative and targeting

**Seed/Series A Reality:**
- Working with creative agencies = 2-week cycles (too slow)
- DIY creative = inconsistent quality and founder time
- **Pain:** Can't test fast enough to find winning creative angles

**✅ Current v6.1 Coverage:**
Module 2 mentions "10-20 variants/week vs. 2-3 manual" (line 175)
"Creative Strategy & Production" section exists (lines 174-181)

**Recommended Changes:**

1. **Move creative velocity EARLIER in value proposition:**
Update "What I Do" → "Hands-On Execution" section (line 100-105):
```markdown
**Hands-On Execution:**
- Use AI agents and workflows to execute 3x faster than traditional methods
- Creative production: 20 variants/week (vs. 2-3 manual) with systematic testing framework
- Campaign launches in 48 hours (vs. 2-week agency cycles)
- Daily optimization and analysis (vs. weekly check-ins)
```

2. **Add "systematic creative testing framework" language:**
Emphasize it's not just volume, but methodology and pattern discovery

---

### Universal Pain Point #4: **Attribution & Multi-Channel Measurement**

**Owner.com (Series C):**
- "Attribution challenges" for YouTube and upper-funnel channels
- **Pain:** Can't prove ROI on brand/awareness channels, stuck on direct response

**DMS (PE-Backed):**
- "Zero measurement framework, no benchmarks or targets"
- **Pain:** "No way to track progress or improvements, likely underperforming but no one knows"

**Seed/Series A Reality:**
- Using platform attribution (Meta says it works!)
- No cross-channel view or incrementality understanding
- **Pain:** Don't know if channels are cannibalizing or complementary

**✅ Current v6.1 Coverage:**
Module 2 mentions attribution analysis (line 187)
❌ Only available for $100K+ spend or $5K add-on (line 192)

**Recommended Changes:**

1. **Include basic cross-channel reporting in base Module 2:**
```markdown
**Analytics & Insights (Ongoing)**
- Weekly performance intelligence with actionable next steps
- Cross-channel performance reporting (unified view across Meta, Google, TikTok)
- Cross-campaign ROAS analysis and pattern discovery
- Anomaly detection with explanations (not just "CAC went up")
- Custom pattern library for YOUR brand (experiment learnings you own)
```

2. **Reserve advanced attribution for high-spend tier:**
Keep attribution modeling, LTV analysis, profit optimization for $100K+ tier

3. **Add "Measurement Framework" to Module 1:**
Update Strategic Leadership section:
```markdown
**Strategic Leadership (Ongoing)**
- Audit + 6-month growth roadmap (first 30 days)
  - Measurement framework: KPIs, benchmarks, and success criteria
  - Short/medium/long-term prioritization
  - Needs assessment (what you have vs. what you need)
  - North Star KPI alignment and measurement framework
```

---

### Universal Pain Point #5: **Team Capability Gaps & Coaching**

**Owner.com (Series C):**
- Wyatt new CMO (2 months), team changes coming
- Hiring Head of Growth but wants fractional-to-full-time path
- **Pain:** Need to de-risk hiring, want to see capabilities before committing

**DMS (PE-Backed):**
- "Team lacks knowledge of paid media account structure at scale"
- "Missing basics: Google Ads setup, naming conventions, ad formats"
- **Pain:** Team needs coaching and elevation, not just strategy docs

**Seed/Series A Reality:**
- First marketing hire or small team with gaps
- Can't afford senior specialists across all channels
- **Pain:** Need someone who can both execute AND teach team to be self-sufficient

**✅ Current v6.1 Coverage:**
Module 1 mentions "Growth leaders with internal team who need AI upgrade + strategic direction"
❌ Doesn't emphasize the coaching/capability building aspect enough

**Recommended Changes:**

Add explicit "Team Coaching & Capability Building" to Module 1:
```markdown
**Team Coaching & Capability Building**
- Level up internal marketers with systematic frameworks and best practices
- Regular 1:1 coaching on channel strategy, creative, analytics
- Documentation of processes and decisions (pattern library you own)
- Your team becomes permanently more capable, not dependent on vendor

**Who This Is For:**
- CEO/COO with strategic leadership vacuum in growth
- Growth leaders with internal team who need AI upgrade + strategic direction
- Operators who want to build AI-native growth capabilities and elevate team skills
```

---

## Summary: Recommended Changes to v6.1 (Keep ICP Unchanged)

### ✅ Changes That Strengthen Core Seed/Series A Offering

**1. Add "Channel Dependency Risk" Problem**
- Explicit problem statement about over-reliance on 1-2 channels
- Applies to Seed/Series A (often over-indexed on Meta)
- Currently buried, should be standalone section

**2. Upgrade AI Team Enablement Language**
- Use DMS language: "Equip team to leverage AI in daily workflows"
- Add "ongoing coaching" emphasis (not one-time training)
- Rename "AI Capability Building" to "AI Team Enablement"
- Add "live training" description (watch me, then practice)

**3. Emphasize Creative Velocity Earlier**
- Move creative production stats to "What I Do" section
- Add "systematic testing framework" language (not just volume)
- Emphasize pattern discovery (what works and WHY)

**4. Add "Measurement Framework" Language**
- Add to Module 1 Strategic Leadership section
- Resonates with DMS pain ("zero measurement framework")
- Applies to many Seed/Series A companies (informal tracking)

**5. Add Team Capability Building Section**
- Explicit section on coaching and team elevation
- Emphasize permanent value creation (team gets better)
- Make clear this isn't just execution, but knowledge transfer

**6. Include Basic Cross-Channel Reporting in Base Module 2**
- Seed/Series A companies need cross-channel visibility too
- Keep advanced attribution (incrementality, LTV) for $100K+ tier
- Add "unified view across channels" to base analytics

---

### ❌ What We Should NOT Change

**Keep These Unchanged:**
- ❌ ICP: Seed/Series A consumer subscription apps (don't expand to B2B or Series B/C)
- ❌ Pricing Model: 10% of spend minimum $5K (works for target market)
- ❌ Market Positioning: Consumer apps, not B2B SaaS
- ❌ Team Replacement Value Prop: Still core for Seed/Series A
- ❌ "Fractional-to-Full-Time" Language: Dilutes sustainable partner positioning

**How to Handle Series B/C and B2B:**
- Custom deals outside core offering (like DMS and Owner.com)
- Don't dilute brand with multiple ICPs
- Keep focus tight, handle outliers as enterprise deals

---

## Action Plan

### Immediate: Update v6.1 with Pain Point Learnings

**Priority 1 Changes (High Impact):**
1. Add "Channel Dependency Risk" to Problems section
2. Update AI-Native Growth Operations language (DMS wording)
3. Add "Measurement Framework" to Module 1
4. Move creative velocity to "What I Do" section

**Priority 2 Changes (Medium Impact):**
5. Add Team Coaching & Capability Building to Module 1
6. Include cross-channel reporting in base Module 2

**Priority 3 Changes (Polish):**
7. Rename "AI Capability Building" to "AI Team Enablement"
8. Add "systematic testing framework" throughout

### Then: Validate with Business-Partner Agent

**Key Questions:**
- Do these changes strengthen positioning without diluting ICP?
- Is "channel de-risking" a strong enough pain point to feature prominently?
- Does team capability building differentiate us from agencies?
- Should we include more measurement/analytics emphasis?

### Finally: Prepare Custom Owner.com Proposal

Use learnings to create custom deal:
- Channel Expansion Specialist positioning
- YouTube validation sprint → multi-channel expansion
- $20-30K/month custom scope
- Keep separate from core Seed/Series A offering
