- Client: Sage Health (hellosage.com)
- Provides care providers/families a system for how to keep track of loved ones (e.g. health updates) on how they are doing.
- Series B - raised $35m recently and raised $60m to date. They have the money and know they need to scale
- Client contact wants to work with David is their new CMO (she is a part of a community with David called Sunday Dinner)
- The ask:
	- Have a competitor who just announced $100m in funding, which caused them to want to go back into fundraising
	- Investors they've been reaching out to aren't that aware of them (their marketing is lacking)
	- The competitor product is not as fast or well regarded, but their marketing is ahead
- They just hired a Head of Content, who is just getting up to speed
- They plan to kick off a product marketing campaign around their fall detection, to get awareness around the product they have
- They want investors to see this campaign too in order to boost awareness
	- David thinks the primary motivation for Sage is for investors to see it, with a secondary goal being customer acquisition
- They need help with a GTM to get the word out
- Sage doesn't have a huge budget for paid acq (e.g. we are not going to spend $100k on LinkedIn on this), but they will do it incrementally and then grow what works; e.g. a scrappy test
	- David thinks we'd create a funnel - market the product with a CTA to learn more, get interest signals
- Potential areas of collaboration:
	- Specific ask: Helping align on how to scale a program with paid amplification
		- David: figures out what content to create and how to distribute it
	- David wants to use my systematic approach to developing strategy and testing distribution approaches
		- Help figure out whether this should be paid ads or influencers
		- Help manage the execution of the paid program, bring in the right resources to manage it or manage it myself
	- Ancillary: Create an AI system that can be scaled internally for content specifically (content creation, library of creative assets for ads)
		- Using agents for our work while getting paid for it
- Personas of their target marketing
	- Investors
	- People in their mid-life, thinking about what type of home their parents should go to
	- Late life people who are thinking about this for themselves
	- Care home professionals
		- Property Managers, managers, investors
		- **Summary:**  The population size of target managers/property owners for a solution like Sage Health is likely **40,000–50,000 across the U.S.** This number may be higher when including small multi-site operators, but most buyers run a single community or a small group, aligning with Sage’s customer base.
- Malachi Quick Thoughts
	- For Consumers
		- Do paid influencer marketing + paid ad boosting
		- Drive to free content pieces with customized landing page funnels
		- Get them to engage with content
	- For home professionals
		- The audience is too small, so we might need to reach them indirectly = retargeting
- Need them to define what success looks like for this campaign:
	- Is it to drive awareness?
	- Is it to create content materials for sales?
- Proposal:
	- Put together the things we would do and the cost
	- They want us to put together an outline of what the approach would be and the cost
- Next steps:
	- David will send her clarifying questions: What are the 5-6 questions we would need in order to put together a proposal for this?
		- Goals/objectives?
		- Success outcomes?
		- Target audience for this campaign?
		- Existing creative assets? Ability to generate landing pages?
		- Budget max?
	- Develop a short proposal
