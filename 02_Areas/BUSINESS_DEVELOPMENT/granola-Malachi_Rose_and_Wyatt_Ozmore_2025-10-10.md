  - Over $1M quarterly spend
  - October pacing to best month ever (2x growth)
- Primary goal: de-risk Meta dependency
  - Target: <50% of leads from Meta by end of next year
  - While continuing to scale Meta performance
- Google Search limited by low search volume
  - Generic queries compete with Wix, etc.
  - Not scalable as primary channel

### Product Roadmap

### Channel Exploration

- Looking for Head of Growth Marketing
- Open to fractional arrangements leading to full-time
- Potential team changes between now and December 1st

### My Questions

- Current growth: Series C, triple-digit retention, $1M+ quarterly Meta spend
- Goals: De-risk Meta (<50% leads), find scalable new channels
- Problems: Attribution challenges, creative acceleration needs, channel diversification
- PMF confirmed as “insane”
- Focused on bottom 25% market segment
- Website builder becoming core self-service flow

### Next Steps
