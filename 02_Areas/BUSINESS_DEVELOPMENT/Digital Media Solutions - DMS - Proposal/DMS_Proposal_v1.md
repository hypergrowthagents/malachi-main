# Fractional Head of Growth Marketing
## Strategic Partnership Proposal for DMS

---

## Executive Summary

DMS faces a critical growth marketing leadership gap. After disbanding the central growth team, your organization is operating with **no strategic oversight, no measurement framework, and massive execution gaps** across decentralized buyers.

**The opportunity is substantial:** Transform your fragmented growth operations into a coordinated, data-driven machine with world-class processes, clear accountability, and elevated team capabilities. With PE backing and appetite to invest when ROI is clear, you have the resources—you need the operational leadership to channel them effectively.

**I propose a 6-month fractional Head of Growth engagement** to build the infrastructure, processes, and team capabilities that create sustainable competitive advantage. Using a similar rapid-diagnosis methodology that delivered 60-70% CAC reduction for KidStrong, this engagement focuses on establishing strong foundations in 90 days and demonstrating measurable transformation by 6 months.

**Recommended approach:** 3 days/week at $25,000/month, with flexibility to scale to 2 days/week at $17,500/month if needed.

## Understanding Your Challenge

Based on our conversation, you're facing interconnected challenges that require immediate leadership:

### Leadership Vacuum
- Teams operating independently without strategic coordination
- No one organizing, refining, or verifying growth marketing strategy
- Decentralized buyers scattered across business units post-team disbanding
- Team members need leadership, coaching, coordination, and education

### Zero Measurement Framework
- No success metrics, goals, or benchmarks established
- No way to track progress or improvements
- Likely underperforming reasonable objectives (but none have been set)

### Fundamental Execution Gaps
- Team lacks knowledge of paid media account structure at scale
- Missing basics: Google Ads setup, naming conventions, ad formats
- Everything done manually with no automation capabilities
- Operating at <10% owned and operated traffic vs. industry leaders' majority

### Strategic Opportunity Unrealized
- Deep pockets from PE ownership willing to invest when ROI is clear
- Good people who are willing to learn (not a talent problem)
- A vision for data-driven content strategy informed by advertising insights
- Potential to reverse-engineer ad insights to build owned content that drives traffic

**The core issue:** You have the resources and talent, but lack the strategic leadership to channel these assets into coordinated, measurable growth.

---

## The Opportunity: What's Possible

**With proper operational leadership, your team can achieve:**

**Operational Excellence:**
- Proven measurement frameworks with clear KPIs and accountability
- Best-practice paid media account structure (setup, naming, formats, automation)
- Data infrastructure that enables optimization and strategic decision-making
- Systematic processes that elevate team performance and coordination
- AI-powered workflows that multiply team effectiveness and build competitive moats

**Team Transformation:**
- Decentralized buyers coordinated into unified strategic execution
- Capability elevation through coaching and best-practice implementation
- Culture shift from reactive/manual to proactive/data-driven
- Knowledge transfer ensuring improvements outlast the engagement

**Strategic Opportunities (To Be Evaluated & Prioritized Together):**

Through stakeholder interviews and initial analysis, we'll identify and prioritize your highest-impact opportunities, which may include:

- **Owned traffic growth strategy:** Moving from <10% toward industry leader benchmarks (50-80% owned)
- **AI competitive advantage:** Advanced implementation across growth operations
- **Creative & targeting optimization:** Testing frameworks and performance improvement
- **Data-driven content strategy:** Reverse-engineering ad insights to inform owned content
- **Lead quality improvements:** Higher-intent users at more sustainable economics

The specific opportunities we pursue will be determined by what will drive the most impact for DMS based on our discovery work.

## Investment Options

### Option 1: Comprehensive Engagement (Recommended)
**3 days per week at $25,000/month**

- Hands-on support implementing AI into daily operations and workflows

### Option 2: Strategic Guidance Engagement
**2 days per week at $17,500/month**

This option focuses on strategic leadership, planning, and coaching with reduced hands-on execution support. Best suited if you have strong internal execution capacity or want to start with lighter engagement.

**What you get with 2 days/week:**

**Strategic Leadership:**
- Consistent dedicated leadership 2 specific days/week
- Strategic planning, roadmap development, and progress tracking

- Focus on planning and oversight vs. detailed implementation

**AI Implementation (Reduced Scope):**
- High-level AI opportunity identification
- Recommendations on AI tools and approaches to explore
- Team largely self-directed on AI implementation
- Less hands-on support and custom workflow development

**Trade-offs to consider:**
- Less frequent meetings and touchpoints with broader team
- Less detailed campaign feedback and optimization support
- Reduced AI implementation depth and team enablement
- More reliance on internal team for execution vs. collaborative implementation

### Logistics
- **6-month initial term** with 14-day opt-out clause (either side, any reason)
- **Post-6 months:** Rolls to month-to-month continuation
- **Specific days committed** each week (consistent schedule with flexibility when needed)
- **Remote-first engagement** with potential for occasional on-site visits
- **Travel and expenses** not included; discussed case-by-case if needed

### Optional Performance Incentives
I'm open to adding performance-based incentives, which I've seen be highly motivational in previous engagement. We can set aggressive improvement goals tied to bonus payouts upon achievement (e.g. +50% bonus if KPI is achieved). This is completely optional and at your discretion.
