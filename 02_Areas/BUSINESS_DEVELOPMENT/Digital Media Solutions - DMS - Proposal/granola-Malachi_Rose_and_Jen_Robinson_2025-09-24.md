- Primary verticals: auto/home insurance (P&C), health (Medicare), education
- Jen joined as CTO 30 days ago, overseeing product and technology

### Current State & Challenges

- Fragmented technology systems never fully integrated
- Media buying organization operates entirely manually
- No optimization between sell-side and buy-side operations
- Lost major auto insurance lead gen business during COVID (customers weren’t driving/shopping)

### Technology Assets

- Sophisticated real-time matching engine for lead auctions

### Questions to Ask

- What’s driving the current growth at DMS?
- How does the company think about AI integration?
- What would success look like in this role?
- What are the biggest challenges the team is facing?

### Product Next Steps

- They have a real-time lead matching engine that works pretty well
- Spending next month defining business vision and strategy
- Board meeting end of October - need to present clear plan
- Media buying organization does everything manually - big opportunity to optimize

### Role

- Not currently an open requisition
- Needs someone to run traffic acquisition and growth
- Strategy for owned & operated platforms, search and social strategy
- They have a Chief Growth Officer who is more of a CRO
- Uncertain where this role sits organizationally (with Jen vs CGO)

### Strategic Vision

- Formalize fragmented platform for scalability
- Abstract technology to enable quick vertical expansion beyond current focus
- Implement automation and optimization in media buying
- Create cohesive buy-side to sell-side optimization
- Potential expansion into financial services/consumer finance

### AI Opportunity

- Vision for soup-to-nuts approach:
  - Traffic acquisition strategy using research tools
  - AI-generated creatives and campaigns
  - Dynamic/personalized content based on search queries
- Need to rebuild from ground up due to AI Overview impact on organic sites

### Engagement Structure

- Fractional arrangement discussed as starting point
- Proven successful model: 3 days/week with flexibility for other projects
- Process: analysis/diagnostics → roadmap → systematic execution
- Allows both sides to evaluate fit before full commitment

### Next Steps

- Jen to draft role description and proposal
- Malachi to review and provide counter-proposal if sufficient detail
- Potential follow-up discussion for more detailed problem-solving approach
- Timeline aligns with Malachi’s goal of building startup while consulting
