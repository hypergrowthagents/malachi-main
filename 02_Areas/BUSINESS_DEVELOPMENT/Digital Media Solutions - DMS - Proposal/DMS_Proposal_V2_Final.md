# Fractional Head of Growth Marketing
## Strategic Partnership Proposal for DMS

---

## Executive Summary

DMS faces a critical growth marketing leadership gap. After disbanding the central growth team, your organization is operating with **no strategic oversight, no measurement framework, and massive execution gaps** across decentralized buyers.

**The opportunity is substantial:** Transform your fragmented growth operations into a coordinated, data-driven machine with world-class processes, clear accountability, and elevated team capabilities. With PE backing and appetite to invest when ROI is clear, you have the resources—you need the operational leadership to channel them effectively.

**I propose a 6-month fractional Head of Growth engagement** to build the infrastructure, processes, and team capabilities that create sustainable competitive advantage. Using the same methodology that delivered 60-70% CAC reduction for KidStrong, this engagement focuses on establishing strong foundations in 90 days and demonstrating measurable transformation by 6 months.

**Recommended approach:** 3 days/week at $25,000/month, with flexibility to scale to 2 days/week at $17,500/month if needed.

## Understanding Your Challenge

Based on our conversation, you're facing interconnected challenges that require immediate leadership:

### Leadership Vacuum
- Teams operating independently without coordination; decentralized buyers need leadership, coaching, and strategic direction
- No one organizing, refining, or verifying growth marketing strategy

### Zero Measurement Framework
- No success metrics, goals, or benchmarks established
- No way to track progress or improvements
- Likely underperforming reasonable objectives (but none have been set)

### Fundamental Execution Gaps
- Team lacks knowledge of paid media account structure at scale
- Missing basics: Google Ads setup, naming conventions, ad formats
- Everything done manually with no automation capabilities
- Operating at <10% owned and operated traffic vs. industry leaders' majority

### Strategic Opportunity Unrealized
- Strong team and PE resources ready to deploy when properly directed
- Vision for data-driven content strategy informed by advertising insights
- Potential to reverse-engineer ad insights to build owned content that drives traffic

**The core issue:** You have the resources and talent, but lack the strategic leadership to channel these assets into coordinated, measurable growth.

---

## The Opportunity: What's Possible

**With proper operational leadership, your team can achieve:**

**Operational Excellence:**
- Proven measurement frameworks with clear KPIs and accountability
- Best-practice paid media account structure (setup, naming, formats, automation)
- Data infrastructure that enables optimization and strategic decision-making
- Systematic processes that elevate team performance and coordination
- AI-powered workflows that multiply team effectiveness and build competitive moats

**Team Transformation:**
- Decentralized buyers coordinated into unified strategic execution
- Capability elevation through coaching and best-practice implementation
- Culture shift from reactive/manual to proactive/data-driven
- Knowledge transfer ensuring improvements outlast the engagement

**Strategic Opportunities (To Be Evaluated & Prioritized Together):**

We'll identify and prioritize your highest-impact opportunities, which may include:

- **Owned traffic growth strategy:** Moving from <10% toward industry leader benchmarks (50-80% owned)
- **AI competitive advantage:** Advanced implementation across growth operations
- **Creative & targeting optimization:** Testing frameworks and performance improvement
- **Data-driven content strategy:** Reverse-engineering ad insights to inform owned content
- **Lead quality improvements:** Higher-intent users at more sustainable economics

Specific priorities will emerge from discovery.

## Timeline Expectations

**This is a 6-month transformation with progressive milestones:**

**30 Days:** Foundation & clarity—diagnosis complete, roadmap built, baselines established

**90 Days:** Implementation & early progress—processes in place, initiatives launched, early positive signals emerging

**6 Months:** Measurable transformation—demonstrable improvements to North Star metrics, sustainable infrastructure, clear success trend line

**Realistic expectations:** You should see operational improvements and early positive signals by 90 days, with measurable business impact becoming clear over the full 6-month engagement.

---

## Deliverables & Working Cadence

### Regular Deliverables
- **Growth Strategy Roadmap:** Prioritized initiatives across short, medium, and long-term
- **Weekly (or Bi-weekly) Status Updates:** Notable launches, KPI changes, and progress against roadmap
- **Monthly Strategy Reviews:** Implementation progress and next priorities
- **Quarterly Business Reviews:** Comprehensive assessment of progress, reassessment of problems/opportunities, and strategic realignment

### Ongoing Collaboration
- **Shared communication channel** (Slack or equivalent) for real-time coordination
- **Weekly team meetings** to build culture, share wins, reduce silos, and maintain alignment
- **Regular 1:1s** with team leads and cross-functional stakeholders (cadence TBD to avoid over-meeting)
- **Executive discussions** as needed (separate from monthly reviews if required)

### AI Implementation Deliverables
- AI capability assessment and opportunity identification

## Investment Options

### Option 1: Comprehensive Engagement (Recommended)
**3 days per week at $25,000/month**

Given the complexity of your challenges—leadership vacuum, zero measurement, fundamental execution gaps—I recommend the comprehensive 3-day/week engagement to ensure sufficient bandwidth for both strategic leadership and hands-on transformation.

**What you get with 3 days/week:**

**Strategic Leadership:**
- Consistent leadership 3 days/week with deep involvement in strategy, execution, and stakeholder management
- Weekly team meetings to build culture and maintain alignment

**Hands-On Execution Support:**
- Regular 1:1s with team leads AND cross-functional stakeholders
- Detailed campaign review with specific feedback and optimization recommendations
- Active participation in high-priority project execution
- Nuanced marketing strategy development and iteration

**AI Implementation (Larger Scope):**
- AI capability assessment and opportunity analysis
- **Claude Code rollout across team** with training materials and ongoing enablement
- **Equip team with powerful AI tools and knowledge** to solve almost any problem independently
- Outline custom AI workflow development for DMS-specific needs
- Hands-on support implementing AI into daily operations and workflows

### Option 2: Strategic Guidance Engagement
**2 days per week at $17,500/month**

Strategic leadership, planning, and coaching with reduced hands-on execution support. Best suited if you have strong internal execution capacity or want to start with lighter engagement.

**What you get with 2 days/week:**

Includes strategic planning, bi-weekly meetings (vs. weekly), and high-level oversight.

**Reduced scope:**
- 1:1 frequency (team leads only, limited stakeholder engagement)
- Campaign detail (high-level review vs. detailed feedback)
- AI implementation depth (recommendations vs. hands-on enablement)
- More reliance on internal team for execution vs. collaborative implementation

### Logistics
- **6-month initial term** with 14-day opt-out clause (either side, any reason)
- **Post-6 months:** Rolls to month-to-month continuation
- **Specific days committed** each week (consistent schedule with flexibility when needed)
- **Remote-first engagement** with potential for occasional on-site visits
- **Travel and expenses** not included; discussed case-by-case if needed

### Optional Performance Incentives
I'm open to adding performance-based incentives, which I've seen be highly motivational in previous engagements. We can set aggressive improvement goals tied to bonus payouts upon achievement (e.g. +50% bonus if KPI is achieved). This is completely optional and at your discretion.
