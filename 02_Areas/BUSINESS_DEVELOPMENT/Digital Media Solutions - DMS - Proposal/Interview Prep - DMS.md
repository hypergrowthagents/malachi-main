## 🔥 Interview Questions They'll Ask + Your Answers

### **1. Media Buying Leadership at Scale**
**Q: "Tell me about your experience scaling paid media across multiple channels. What was your largest budget and how did you optimize it?"**

**Your Answer:**
"At Zynga I managed $50M+ annual media budget across 30+ ad networks as Director of Growth Marketing. I contributed to their financial turnaround by bringing all user acquisition in-house, implementing programmatic buying strategies, and developing dynamic LTV and budget allocation systems. We achieved a 55% ROAS increase - my team won the 'Green Beret' highest impact award.

More recently at MAVAN, I built the paid growth engine for hypergrowth AI startups like ElevenLabs and Fireflies.ai - both scaled from zero to over $1M per month in profitable spend. For Fireflies specifically, I achieved sub-$250 CPA on Non-Brand campaigns and sub-$150 on Competitor campaigns, which validated 3x budget scaling to $900 daily spend.

My approach combines three elements: data-driven bidding strategies, systematic creative testing frameworks, and closed-loop attribution so I can optimize across the full funnel, not just top-of-funnel metrics."

---

### **2. AI/ML Optimization Experience**
**Q: "How have you used AI or machine learning to improve campaign performance? Can you give specific examples?"**

**Your Answer:**
"I've approached AI/ML in two phases across my career. Early on at Digit, I partnered with our Data Science team to build an ML-powered pLTV model with less than 10% error rate for user-level churn prediction. This allowed us to optimize bidding and budget allocation based on predicted lifetime value, not just acquisition cost. We doubled ARR that first year while maintaining healthy LTV-to-CAC unit economics.

More recently at MAVAN, I led our comprehensive AI transformation from mid-2024 through 2025. The flagship project was an Ad Prediction Engine built on Claude Sonnet-4 API. It scores creative performance across 5 weighted categories with 75%+ accuracy and generates 3 high-converting variants per analysis - essentially predicting ad performance before we spend media dollars.

I also built 40+ automated workflows for campaign optimization, diagnostics, and reporting. For example, creative brief development went from 60 minutes to 10 minutes, and we built automated Meta Ads diagnostic reports running twice weekly. The key was achieving 100% team adoption - all 7 core team members actively using AI daily, which created compounding efficiency gains."

---

### **3. Closed-Loop Growth Systems**
**Q: "Describe a time you connected acquisition metrics with downstream monetization. What was the outcome?"**

**Your Answer:**
"At 38TERA, I inherited a situation where Meta was reporting 1.03 ROAS but the actual ROAS was 0.19 - a massive attribution problem. I led a complete TripleWhale integration connecting Shopify, ad platforms, and subscription tools with 15-minute data refresh cycles. This gave us accurate LTV tracking across all touchpoints and enabled real-time optimization decisions based on true profitability, not platform-reported metrics.

At Digit, I built this closed-loop thinking into the foundation. I partnered with Product Marketing, Growth Engineering, Data Science, and Finance to develop that ML-powered pLTV model. This meant we weren't just optimizing for subscribers - we were optimizing for predicted lifetime value. We doubled ARR and subscribers in the first year while maintaining healthy unit economics, which directly contributed to our successful Series C fundraise and eventual $212M exit to Oportun.

The pattern I've learned is that most growth teams stop at acquisition metrics. The real leverage comes from connecting acquisition costs to actual customer behavior, retention, and monetization - then feeding that back into bidding strategies and channel allocation."

---

### **4. Owned & Operated Properties Growth**
**Q: "Have you grown owned & operated properties before? How did you balance immediate acquisition with long-term brand building?"**

**Your Answer:**
"At Zynga, I led the Words With Friends 2 worldwide launch which hit #1 Top Free App Overall and #8 Top Grossing in the US. This required balancing performance marketing with brand building - we ran a national TV campaign alongside digital performance channels. The key was having clear metrics for both: CPA and ROAS for performance, but also brand lift studies and organic rank tracking for long-term value.

At Digit, I was the first marketing hire responsible for building the growth function from scratch. We scaled from 5 to 20+ channels and achieved #6 finance app ranking on iOS. This required balancing immediate subscriber acquisition with long-term app store optimization and organic growth. I built systematic creative testing - 4x'd our creative development capacity - which gave us both immediate performance wins and brand assets that drove organic downloads.

The framework I use is: set clear KPIs for both immediate performance (CPA, ROAS, CAC:LTV) and long-term brand health (organic traffic, brand search volume, retention cohorts). Then allocate budget based on payback windows - quick wins fund longer-term brand investments."

---

### **5. Data Partnership & Infrastructure Building**
**Q: "Tell me about working with data teams to build the infrastructure needed for growth marketing."**

**Your Answer:**
"At Digit, I partnered closely with our Data Science team to build the ML-powered pLTV model from scratch. This wasn't just a 'nice to have' - it became core infrastructure that powered our bidding strategies, budget allocation, and creative testing prioritization. We achieved less than 10% error rate which meant we could trust it for real-time optimization decisions.

At MAVAN, I tackled this for multiple clients. For 38TERA, the critical need was attribution accuracy. I led the TripleWhale integration connecting Shopify, all ad platforms, and subscription tools. The result was a custom dashboard with 15-minute refresh cycles and accurate LTV tracking. For Velocity Global, I had to recover their Meta Business Manager and implement proper conversion tracking - the previous agency had been spending $350K/month inefficiently because the data infrastructure was broken.

I've also implemented first-party server-side tracking to overcome iOS 14+ limitations, and built multi-touch attribution models for comprehensive journey analysis. My philosophy is: growth marketing is only as good as the data infrastructure underneath it. I always start by auditing what exists, identifying gaps, and then partnering with data teams to build what's needed before scaling spend."

## 🎯 Opening 2-Minute Intro

*"Thanks for taking the time today - I'm really excited about this opportunity at DMS.*

*I see this role sitting at the intersection of three things I've built my career on: AI-driven media buying at scale, closed-loop attribution and monetization, and building high-performing growth teams from the ground up.*

*Most recently at MAVAN, I led our AI transformation where I built an Ad Prediction Engine using Claude's API, created 40+ automated workflows, and scaled clients like Fireflies and ElevenLabs from zero to over $1 million per month in profitable spend. That work taught me how to use AI not just as a tool, but as core infrastructure for optimization and automation.*

*Before MAVAN, at Digit I was the first marketing hire - built the growth function from scratch, doubled ARR, and developed an ML-powered lifetime value model with less than 10% error rate. And at Zynga I managed over $50 million in annual media budgets across 30+ networks, achieving a 55% ROAS increase.*

*What excites me about DMS is the opportunity to bring AI-driven automation and optimization to owned & operated properties at scale. It's exactly what I've been doing - just applied to your unique performance marketing platform model. I'm curious to learn more about the specific growth challenges you're looking to solve."*

## 📝 Mock Interview Practice Session

### **Round 1: Scaling Paid Media While Maintaining Efficiency**

**Q: "Walk me through a time when you had to scale paid media spend aggressively while maintaining or improving efficiency. What was your approach, what challenges did you face, and what were the results?"**

---

**INITIAL RESPONSE (Raw):**
"The first thing that comes to mind as my answer for this would be recently with Fireflies.ai, which is an AI note-taking software that joins your meetings and records notes for you. They came to us to essentially build out performance marketing from the ground up, starting with Google Search. This is a client who is in a hyper-competitive space, wanted to scale up quickly, had aggressive targets for their cost of a customer acquisition, and we needed to be able to hit that number while scaling spend and initially do so just with one channel being Google Search. So, our approach here is first we mapped out what we wanted the media strategy to be. We audited the account which was at extremely low spend. We looked at the competitive landscape and we identified a plan to get them up to a half million a month in spend by 6 months in the future. 3-6 months in the future and a million in spend, profitable spend by the end of the year and to do so through a sequencing of figuring out the core channel, getting the right conversion events in place, dialing in user quality, figuring out which keywords were converting, optimizing the conversion funnel, properly valuing each of the different user segments. We needed to split out business users from personal users since there was almost a 10X LTV separation between the two and ensure that we were sending the right signal through doing a correlation analysis of LTV back to trial behavior and realizing that they were actually pretty tightly coupled, that people who started trials tended to move on to being paid subscribers at a pretty high rate. So we were able to move the signal higher and that gave us more data to optimize more quickly within the campaigns themselves. Then we had to take on a real in terms of like scaling Google search specifically. We initially were just in the US. We went through a pretty robust international scaling strategy which by itself was something like enabled us to scale 3X while dropping our CAC. And that was even without language localization. So adding in language localization was also part of the plan as well as expanding into PMax, then Meta, and then YouTube and TikTok. We had a multi-part strategy that involved sequentially dialing in who our core audience was, testing new adjacent audiences, expanding copy moving internationally, improving our mosaic signals, and test and cut and test and cut and dialing that in and in and in over time until we found breakthroughs and cutting back on things that weren't working. All throughout this there was a lot of competition surging in the marketplace that was putting a lot of pressure on CAC. So at times when we would see CAC increase we would slow it down or pull back and spend a little bit, figure out where we were seeing weakness what we could do about that and come up with a strategy around that. And sometimes that involved getting a bit more aggressive on some campaigns that were performing well and dialing back on others that were experiencing more competition. And also just meant making sure that we had enough diversification of where our spend was going to enable us to deal without directly facing just like exponential cost growth."

**COACHING FEEDBACK:**

✅ **What's Strong:**
- **Specific client:** Fireflies.ai - AI note-taking (relevant to DMS)
- **Clear stakes:** Hyper-competitive space, aggressive CAC targets
- **Concrete results:** $0 → $500K/month in 3-6 months, $1M+ by year-end
- **Technical depth:** Conversion signal optimization, LTV segmentation, trial-to-paid correlation

⚠️ **What Needs Improvement:**
1. **Too long & meandering** - Lost the thread multiple times, interviewer will tune out
2. **Missing STAR structure** - Situation/Task/Action/Result got muddled
3. **Key metrics buried** - "Sub-$250 CPA" and "3X international scaling while dropping CAC" are huge wins but got lost
4. **No clear result statement** - What was the FINAL outcome? Did you hit the $1M/month target?

**Specific Coaching Tips:**
1. **Lead with outcome upfront** - "$0 to $1M/month in 12 months" hooks them immediately
2. **Use "First/Then/Finally" structure** - Makes it easy to follow your logic
3. **Quantify 2-3 key wins** - Sub-$250 CPA, 3X international scale, $1M/month target hit
4. **End with "the key was..."** - Shows you can extract learnings, not just execute

---

**REFINED ANSWER (60-Second Version):**

"The best example is Fireflies.ai, an AI note-taking tool in a hyper-competitive space. They came to us at near-zero spend with an aggressive goal: scale to $1M+ per month in profitable Google Search spend within 12 months while maintaining strict CAC targets.

My approach was sequential scaling with tight conversion signal optimization:

**First,** we fixed the fundamentals - proper conversion events, LTV segmentation separating business users from personal users (10X LTV difference), and a correlation analysis that let us optimize on trial starts instead of waiting for paid conversions. This gave us more data velocity.

**Then** we executed a systematic expansion strategy: started US-only, scaled 3X internationally while actually dropping CAC, added language localization, then sequentially expanded to PMax, Meta, YouTube, and TikTok.

We dealt with competitive pressure by diversifying channel mix and dynamically reallocating budget - pulling back on saturated keywords, getting aggressive where we had an edge.

**Results:** We achieved sub-$250 CPA on Non-Brand and sub-$150 on Competitor campaigns, validated 3X budget scaling to $900/day, and hit the $1M/month profitable spend target. The key was treating it like a system, not just buying ads - conversion signal quality, user segmentation, and constant test-and-cut discipline."

### **Round 2: AI/ML Implementation Strategy for DMS**

**Q: "You mentioned AI-driven optimization at MAVAN. But I'm curious - how would you think about implementing AI/ML at DMS specifically? We have owned & operated properties, not just client campaigns. What would be different about your approach here versus what you did at MAVAN?"**

---

**INITIAL RESPONSE (Raw):**
"There are a few tiers to how I think about implementing AI within a company. Think of tier one is people interacting directly with AI chat. And so in order for that to happen, everyone needs to have access to sophisticated models like Claude, Gemini Chat GPT, and information about how to use them to accomplish specific tasks that they have. And start to build shared projects that we can all collectively utilize and build on. Things like existing company background research and copywriting and personas of like a paid search expert. Things like that. Then there's tier two which is finding repeatable tasks and automating those tasks. And for that we would start to map out our workflows, determine which of these workflows likely is gonna have the biggest impact, save time, avoid us having to hire as much like be able to operate pretty efficiently within the team. And we would prioritize that using a investment framework. Decide which of these we would want to build. Determine if we had the capabilities to do it internally. And then we would set up an MVP and just prove out that we could even do the basic workflow before we try to dial that in. And then over time just refining the prompts and the inputs until we get the expected output that we want to. And then Tier 3 is where we start to build more sophisticated AI applications on top of these workflows. And we can determine if it makes sense for us to build like an AI agent that can actually do voice calls for us or that can make specific decisions that come up as in the fork or in the road type of scenario. And are just a lot more dynamic. And these tend to be, you know, bigger investments and require coding in order to accomplish. And so we would probably want to prove those out with initial experiments and just do something very like cheap and raw to get success. We also need a signal on if this is something that is achievable and likely to be worth the energy. And then we can probably prototype a lot of these things internally and it's only once we need to have like final production ready versions for customers would we go off and try and do a little bit more of the like final technical development work.

I think the initial version is just getting familiar with how the internal team uses AI, what processes we have in place that could benefit the most from it, and starting to build out an order of operations from smallest quick wins to biggest projects. To empower the people on the team to be leveraging AI, sharing information through regular team meetups and summits to cross-pollinate ideas, setting up hackathons, and aligning internal incentives against AI solutions that are deployed (whether monetarily or recognition-based or otherwise). All these ladder up into a broader system of how do you get everybody on the same page about utilizing AI to improve results and gain efficiency within the company?"

---

**COACHING FEEDBACK:**

✅ **What's Strong:**
- **Clear 3-tier framework** - Shows you've thought systematically about AI adoption
- **Practical examples** - Shared projects, workflow mapping, investment prioritization
- **Change management thinking** - Hackathons, incentives, team alignment
- **MVP mindset** - "Prove it cheap and raw first" shows you're not naive about implementation

⚠️ **What Needs Improvement:**
1. **Didn't answer the question** - They asked "What's DIFFERENT about DMS vs MAVAN?" You gave a general framework
2. **No owned & operated context** - Missed the key distinction: at DMS you're optimizing YOUR properties, not client campaigns
3. **Too tactical too fast** - Jumped to "Tier 1/2/3" without establishing strategic context for DMS
4. **Missing the business case** - Why does AI matter MORE at DMS than it did at MAVAN?

**Critical Strategic Insight You MUST Address:**
At MAVAN you were consulting - building AI for 50+ different clients with different needs. At DMS, you're building AI infrastructure for ONE business model at scale. This means:
- **Compounding returns:** Every AI improvement benefits ALL your owned properties
- **Proprietary advantage:** You can build competitive moats through AI automation
- **Data network effects:** More properties = more data = better AI models
- **Speed to market:** No client approvals - you can iterate daily

**Specific Coaching Tips:**
1. **Start with the DMS-specific opportunity:** "At DMS, the AI opportunity is actually BIGGER because..."
2. **Then contrast with MAVAN:** "At MAVAN I was building AI for 50 different client use cases. Here I'd be building ONE system that compounds..."
3. **Frame the 3 tiers around DMS priorities:** Tier 1 = team productivity, Tier 2 = media buying automation, Tier 3 = proprietary bidding/creative engines
4. **End with competitive advantage:** "The companies that win in performance marketing will be the ones who can automate creative testing and bidding at scale"

---

**REFINED ANSWER (90-Second Strategic Version):**

"Great question - the opportunity at DMS is actually significantly BIGGER than what I did at MAVAN, and here's why:

At MAVAN, I was building AI systems for 50+ different clients with different business models, data structures, and approval processes. Every AI workflow had to be customized and re-approved. Here at DMS, I'd be building ONE AI infrastructure that compounds across ALL your owned & operated properties. Every improvement benefits the entire portfolio - that's where you get exponential returns.

The strategic difference changes how I'd prioritize. I'd approach it in three phases:

**Phase 1 - Team AI Fluency (Month 1-2):** Get the growth marketing team fluent with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini. Build shared knowledge bases with DMS-specific context - your owned properties, historical performance data, competitive intelligence. Create specialized AI personas like 'DMS Paid Search Expert' trained on your actual campaigns. This is about velocity - making the team 10X faster at creative briefs, competitive analysis, and campaign planning.

**Phase 2 - Workflow Automation (Month 3-6):** Map our highest-leverage repeatable workflows and automate them. Things like daily performance diagnostics across all properties, automated bid adjustments based on cross-property learnings, creative variant generation and testing. The key here is that unlike MAVAN where each client had different workflows, at DMS we can build ONE automated system and scale it across the portfolio. I'd prioritize based on ROI - what saves the most time or unlocks the most budget efficiency?

**Phase 3 - Proprietary AI Advantage (Month 6-12):** Build sophisticated AI applications that become competitive moats. Think AI-powered bidding engines that learn from ALL your owned properties simultaneously, creative prediction models that forecast performance before you spend a dollar, automated A/B testing frameworks that run 24/7 across your portfolio. At MAVAN I built an Ad Prediction Engine for clients - here I'd build one that gets BETTER as you add more properties because it's learning from more data.

The unlock is data network effects. At MAVAN, each client's data was siloed. Here, every new property you acquire makes your AI smarter across the entire portfolio. That's a massive strategic advantage that compounds over time.

What's your current thinking on building proprietary AI versus using platform tools?"

### **Round 3: Rapid-Fire Strategic Questions**

---

#### **Q1: "What's the biggest mistake you've seen companies make when scaling paid media?"**

**INITIAL RESPONSE (Raw):**
"The biggest mistake I've seen companies make with scaling paid media is that investing into enough data with the idea that they're going to lose money in the beginning and that we're actually just optimizing for learning. And they focus too much on the bottom-of-funnel result without realizing that some people require multiple touchpoints or a sequence of different messaging in order to actually convert. Anytime I'm starting any paid media, I build out a testing roadmap and I say, 'I can't guarantee the result of this, but what I can guarantee is by the end of this testing roadmap, we're going to know a lot more about our customers than when we started, and we're going to sequentially be in a better spot by that point.'"

**COACHING FEEDBACK:**
✅ Good: Learning budget concept, multi-touch attribution thinking, testing roadmap framework
⚠️ Issue: First sentence is confusing - "investing into enough data...lose money" doesn't parse clearly. Bury the lede.

**REFINED ANSWER (30 seconds):**
"The biggest mistake is expecting immediate profitability before you've invested in learning. Companies under-invest in the data-gathering phase and then pull the plug too early when campaigns aren't immediately efficient.

I always set expectations upfront: 'We're building a testing roadmap. The first 60-90 days are about learning - which audiences convert, what messaging resonates, how many touchpoints are required. By the end, we'll know our customers better and have a profitable playbook.'

The companies that win are the ones who treat early-stage paid media like R&D, not like a vending machine. What's your current testing budget philosophy at DMS?"

---

#### **Q2: "How do you balance short-term performance targets with long-term channel health?"**

**INITIAL RESPONSE (Raw):**
"I try and set up a like optimization and quick wins almost daily approach to how to operate campaigns separate from a learning budget and bigger swing types of risks that we take with the ultimate goal of like finding breakthroughs or doing more expensive investment type of work on a channel. So an example of that would be, you know, we could probably take steps to in our like operations process to just ensure that we're optimizing campaigns on a more frequent basis and catching things before they go wrong. That's something we can pull back as like a short-term reactionary thing to hit a performance target vs long-term we may identify that what we really need to do is personalize like ability to build out landing pages programmatically. And that's just gonna be like require some infrastructure in place to actually do that. So we can try and test that along the way while we're doing the smaller changes."

**COACHING FEEDBACK:**
✅ Good: Two-budget system concept, short-term optimization vs long-term infrastructure example
⚠️ Issue: Too many filler words ("like"), example is unclear, no clear principle stated upfront

**REFINED ANSWER (30 seconds):**
"I run two parallel budget systems: an optimization budget for daily quick wins, and a learning budget for bigger swings.

Short-term: Daily campaign optimization - bid adjustments, negative keywords, creative rotation. These hit immediate performance targets and keep the business healthy.

Long-term: Strategic tests that might hurt efficiency initially but unlock scale. Things like new channel expansion, programmatic landing page builds, or testing upper-funnel awareness campaigns.

The key is being transparent about which bucket each dollar lives in. I'd never sacrifice long-term channel health for a quarterly target - that's how you end up with no growth runway. How does DMS currently think about balancing these?"

---

#### **Q3: "If you joined DMS and had a $10M annual media budget, where would you focus first?"**

**INITIAL RESPONSE (Raw):**
"I don't know that I can answer that question without knowing more about DMS and how it operates. But essentially how I'd try and answer that question is I would start out by just more deeply analyzing and understanding what is working well with performance marketing at DMS today? What are our best channels? Who are our best customers and clients? And what approaches are working? And try and develop an allocation matrix for how we're investing our resources across the different things that we're doing right now. And then I would also kick off some competitive research and figure out what are the empty spaces? The blue oceans that we're not tapping that might be quite beneficial for us to get into? What are the capabilities we're missing? Maybe that's on infrastructure and technology side? And we put together a roadmap or process that helps us figure out what unlocks we can get, both in the short and the long term, that helps us most effectively build out media budget. And then I would also ensure we're just investing a lot in creative optimization because I think that's where a lot of the energy is going these days is targeting becomes more challenging at a very granular level. And creative becomes more of the heavy lifting that allows you to lean into platform optimization signals."

**COACHING FEEDBACK:**
✅ Good: Analytical approach, competitive research, creative optimization focus, "you're right that I need more context" honesty
⚠️ Issue: Too hedged, no POV. They want to see strategic thinking even without perfect information.

**REFINED ANSWER (45 seconds):**
"Great question - I'd need to understand what's currently working to give you a precise answer, but here's my framework:

**First 30 days:** Deep audit. What channels are working? Who are our best-performing audience segments? Where's our competitive white space? I'd build an allocation matrix showing current ROI by channel and customer segment.

**Based on what I know about performance marketing platforms, I'd hypothesize three focus areas:**

1. **Creative optimization infrastructure** - As targeting gets harder, creative becomes the optimization lever. I'd invest in systematic testing and AI-powered variant generation.

2. **Cross-property learnings** - With multiple owned properties, we should be sharing insights. What works on Property A likely informs Property B.

3. **Attribution accuracy** - Making sure we're measuring true incrementality, not just last-click attribution.

But I'm making assumptions. What are the biggest budget allocation challenges you're seeing right now?"
