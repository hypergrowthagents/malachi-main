## Q2: Relevant Case Studies & Proof Points

**KidStrong - Performance Marketing Turnaround (MOST RELEVANT):**

**Situation:**
- Code red status: CAC deteriorating YoY/MoM for ~18 months

- Franchises back to healthy customer flow
- Marketing no longer a problem area

**Other relevant experience:**
- Never built owned content at scale (honest gap)

- Build AI into workflow as competitive advantage
- Custom AI solutions for DMS-specific needs
- Potential partnerships for advanced implementations
- Team operating with AI-augmented capabilities (6-month goal)

## Q7: Risk Mitigation & Flexibility

**Flexibility:**
