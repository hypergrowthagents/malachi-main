### Goals

- Fill the leadership void in growth marketing
  - No current strategy for growth marketing execution
  - Decentralized buyers scattered across business units after central team disbanded
  - Need leadership, coaching, coordination, and education for existing team members
- Identify objectives and chart strategic plan
  - Develop clear roadmap with prioritized initiatives
  - Create short, medium, and long-term project tiers
- Assess current team capabilities
  - Determine who is performing effectively
  - Identify skill gaps and training needs
- Set vision for DMS growth marketing potential
  - Pull stakeholder input and document comprehensive strategy
  - Communicate vision effectively to hands-on-keyboard teams

### Problem

- Complete vacuum of leadership and coordination
  - Teams operating independently without strategic oversight
  - No one organizing, refining, or verifying growth marketing strategy
- Zero measurement framework
  - No success metrics, goals, or benchmarks established
  - No clear way to track progress or improvements
  - Likely underperforming any reasonable objectives, but none have been set
- Fundamental execution gaps
  - Team doesn’t know how to structure paid media accounts at scale
  - Missing basic knowledge: Google Ads setup, naming conventions, ad formats
  - Everything done manually - no automation capabilities
  - Operating at less than 10% owned and operated traffic (industry leaders do majority in-house)

### Jen’s Vision

- Improve data ecosystem foundation
  - Build reliable data infrastructure for automation and optimization
  - Enable smart research on buy side to inform content strategy
- Reverse-engineer advertising insights for content development
  - Research efficient advertising opportunities first
  - Build owned and operated content strategy around proven demand
  - Create data-driven content that fills identified market needs
- Close monetization feedback loop
  - Optimize for highest yields, conversion rates, and ROI on owned properties
  - Focus on acquiring high-value, high-intent users
  - Improve conversion from owned traffic vs. purchased leads

### Business Model Context

- DMS operates in property and casualty insurance lead generation
  - Verticals: auto, home, education, finance, Medicare
  - Business model: buy and sell leads, clicks, and calls
- Current heavy reliance on third-party lead purchases
  - Less than 10% traffic from owned and operated properties
  - Paying premium to aggregators like Everquote, Media Alpha, Select Quote
  - Receiving lower quality leads from external providers
- Opportunity to increase owned and operated percentage
  - Industry leaders (Nerd Wallet, Lending Tree) generate majority of traffic in-house
  - Target: grow from 10% to 20% owned traffic as initial goal
  - Potential for significantly improved profitability through supply chain ownership

### Available Resources

- Strong financial backing
  - Deep pockets from PE ownership
  - Willing to invest when ROI is clear
- Adequate headcount available
  - May need some role transformations
  - Appetite for strategic hiring when justified
- Existing team with potential
  - Good people who are willing to learn
  - Need education and direction rather than replacement

### Engagement Structure

- Time commitment: 2-3 days per week
  - Allows overlap with team schedules for meetings and collaboration
  - Balance with other projects and responsibilities
- Duration: 6-month initial engagement
  - Mutual opt-out flexibility with reasonable notice
  - Extends through Q4 challenges and into Q1 for proper evaluation
- Reporting structure: Role sits under Rick Fox (CGO)
  - Jen Robinson remains primary stakeholder and driver
  - Rick Fox oversees revenue and both business units

### AI and Technology Integration

- Team has basic competency with ChatGPT and Gemini
  - Need to establish shared projects and knowledge sharing practices
  - Opportunity to implement Claude Code for marketing operations
- Connection with engineering AI pilots
  - Engineering teams already experimenting with AI-assisted development
  - Potential to bridge gap between engineering capabilities and marketing needs
  - Create collaborative environment for automation development

### Next Steps

- Malachi to provide engagement model and cost structure options
- Jen to discuss with Rick Fox and CEO Tim about next steps
- Potential introduction call with Rick Fox to align on approach
- Leadership team already aligned on role spec and strategic direction
