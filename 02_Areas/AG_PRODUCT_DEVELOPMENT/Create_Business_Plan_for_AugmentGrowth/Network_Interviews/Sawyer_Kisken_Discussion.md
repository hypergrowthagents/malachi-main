Wed, 01 Oct 25 · sawyer@roadwayai.com

### Roadway AI Company Update

- Current team: Tim, Sawyer + ~9 engineers (including part-time contractor designer)
    
- New deployment services: Full GTM setup, Segment implementation, gap analysis for new customers
    
    - Hands-on approach to solve first-base implementation problems
        
    - Going well so far
        
- Target customer profile refined:
    
    - High traffic (20,000+ monthly visitors minimum)
        
    - Majority web-based conversions
        
    - Short conversion windows
        
    - Self-serve software (not commerce)
        
    - Growth marketers (not demand gen or sales-led teams)
        
- B2B SaaS focus continues but expanded to prosumer (Webflow, Notion-style companies)
    
- Three-layer vision:
    
    - Structured data transformation
        
    - AI-powered analysis (current focus)
        
    - Workflow automation (starting development)
        
- Market size concerns acknowledged - plan to expand to adjacent business models over time
    

### Malachirose’s New AI-First Growth Company

- Left Maven after 4.5 years to build “Augment Growth” ([augmentgrowth.ai](http://augmentgrowth.ai/))
    
- Philosophy: Human-AI hybrid approach for customer acquisition (not 100% AI)
    
- Phased approach:
    
    - Analytics (paid acquisition focus - Google, Meta APIs)
        
    - Optimization
        
    - Creative development
        
    - Strategic initiatives
        
- Starting as AI-first agency model, eventual productization planned
    
- Built creative prediction engine at Maven - pre-tests ideas before creation
    
- Targeting experimentation feedback loops and daily optimization cycles
    
- Business model: Likely percentage of media spend with guaranteed results
    

### Key Strategic Questions & Potential Collaboration

- Malachirose’s focus areas:
    
    - Right pain points identification
        
    - Proper differentiation
        
    - Viable business model attractiveness
        
    - AI capability building challenges
        
    - Need for sophisticated dashboarding for daily analysis
        
- Potential partnership opportunities discussed:
    
    - Roadway could provide 25% of Malachirose’s data needs
        
    - Shared capability development possible
        
    - Different but overlapping target markets
        
- Market overlap considerations: Malachirose targeting broader Google/Meta users vs Roadway’s Goldilocks customer profile
    

### Next Steps

- Follow-up meeting scheduled for couple weeks in October
    
- Sawyer to email Malachirose to coordinate timing
    
- Tim having first child today - congratulations to send
