These are the key questions I want to think through with Terry:
1. Which path has the greatest likelihood of earning $20k+/mo within 3 months? 
2. Which path offers the greatest upside over the course of a year? 
3. What are the arguments against each path? 
	1. Path 1 - FT Job:
		1. Completely agrees that the traditional corporate job might be in trouble. Lots of economic signals that support my case.
		2. Plan B option: Find a fast paced agency like MAVAN - one that is more established. Where my skillset is most overlapping with what I just did.
			1. I should consider whether this would be all that different than just starting my own AI consultancy... it might be quite similar in terms of what I do.
	2. Path 2 - Advising/Consulting w/ AI capabilities:
	3. Path 3 - New company: 
		1. Likes Augmentgrowth.ai - it shows it supports/helps people. Better to underpromise and overdeliver. Thinks there is no downside in me setting up the business entity right now. I could even keep this as a side hustle.
		2. Also likes the idea of incubating this within my current network to test the idea.
		3. 
4. What is the main case for or against just setting up a new business entity right now regardless of which path I take?

## Notes:
- TLDR; Terry thinks path 3 where I start my own company is a really good idea and has a lot of upside with not a lot of downsides. It still keeps the other paths open. He also really likes the idea of starting with advising/consulting while building this company out and calibrating as I go.
- Answer the questions: What are the activities I would do over the next 90 days for each path?
	- Are there things I would do that would benefit all three paths, and that might be helpful to prioritize?
	- He's not sure I really need to do this work in light of the discussion we had today, since there seems to be a clear roadmap for this.
- Recommend I build out an economic plan for this idea, with metrics laid out of what I need to hit in order to be good financial shape. E.g. if I can't land 3 clients or X revenue by this point, I need to get more serious about a full time role. Then we'll know what we need to hit and align on the plan.
	- What costs do I need to build in?
	2. Customer acquisition costs
- My target market: Series A-C companies who are well funded and investing ample money in paid acquisition.
- Anecdote: his time consulting he learned:
	- Lay out the common problems
	- These are the solutions
	- These are the case studies
	- Here's how we could solve it
- Pitch to Danielle: there are no greater time wasters than applying to job postings. You are dealing with cold outreach. One of the best paths is working warm relationships and using my advising/new business as a foot in the door.
- Sales strategy:
	- Really likes my networking outreach approach pitch:
		- "Hey, I just left MAVAN to go start my own thing at the intersection of growth and AI, doing XYZ. I've always really respected your expertise and I'd love to pick your brain on it if you have a few mins. And we can catch up!"
	- As for whether to talk to them about advising or the growth platform, talking about both is fine. Get their take on it. Maybe either connects with them.

## Action Items:

1. Talk to Danielle on the approach
2. Get the domain setup (augmentgrowth.ai)
3. Write up the vision doc
4. Build a 1-2 year financial plan
5. Build the pitch via website wireframe
6. Set up a C-corp
7. Keep finances separate and save good records

## 9/19/25

- Issue: 45% tax rate is eating a ton of profits
	- Strong recommendation to create a C-corp as my business structure to save on taxes
	- Level of scrutiny on deductions as a C-corp dropped dramatically vs. S-corp/LLC. If I do a S-corp or C-schedule, I will be able to deduct a lot less
	- Could deduct part of my car, parts of my house for office, etc. As long as we have a positive net income, that's the most important
	- Might be able to slice the tax rate down significantly
	- Only kicks in with date of incorporation and after
	- Could do the setup with Legal Zoom pretty cheap
	- I could keep the C-corp for any side hustle even if I am hired full time
	- CA will continue to charge me $800/ year to keep it open each year
	- Thinks i can cut the tax burden to 25% from 45% in the model
- Big problem he's seen over the years is companies hiring people in advance of the demand being there and suddenly increasing their burn rate
	- Recommendation: let the demand drive the investment, but be ready to pull the trigger if the demand justifies it. Have it ready up front, but don't invest
	- Once you've got the deal, you typically have some flexibility of how quickly you need to deliver it
- Potential Value prop for me: I can improve their growth efficiency in orders 
- Paid strategy: Do I think I could get paid to create an assessment/strategy to move into an AI-powered growth approach?
	- Yes - I could take a look at their business and create a strategy for them to get there.
	- Unlike people who only do strategy, I can move into delivering the strategy & services with the right tools and solutions, and even have my own team that can implement
	- The companies with the biggest gap are also going to have the biggest need for help implementing it
- Services
	- Option 1: I do an assessment where 1) I build the strategy/plan > 2) implement the plan > 3) then execute the plan
		- Clients can hire me to do any of these along the continuum
	- Option 2: I build the strategy/plan > then I can move to a retainer where I coach/advise them with how to execute it once it moves to their internal teams
		- I could have a fixed dollar amount retainer where they could call me anytime to help them ongoing as they have questions about implementation. The comfort is worth a lot to people. But they often don't advantage of it commensurate to the cost
		- E.g. For $1k/mo, I will make myself available to jump on Slack or a call to help them with ongoing answers to how to implement things.
		- Also nice because I can have means of seeing where they are getting stuck and then upsell more services
	- Part of my value offering is that since I'm so plugged into AI and how clients are using it, part of my value pitch is that I can keep them updated on the latest way to use AI and continue to keep them in the loop on best practices as part of my offering
- Tip: At the end of each sales call, ask for 3 referrals
	- Include in all sales calls and early referrals calls - "I'm going to ask for a favor - can you think of 3 people who would be interested in hearing about this?"
	- This is a great way to get warm references to people I never would have spoken
	- Stage 1: talk to friends and get feedback and references
		- I do not need to have the product ready for this. Focus on getting this kicked off sooner than later
	- Stage 2: go out and actually try and sell this to the market
		- I do need to have some components of the product/service ready for this stage
- Best advice he's ever heard: Customer asks 3 things to the sales person that they need to be able to answer:
	- Pain points: Do you understand my problem and have solved it before?
	- Industry/Vertical expertise: Do you understand the problem in my industry and have solved it before?
	- References: Do you have case studies of having solved it for companies similar to me?
- Sell first or build first?
	- Terry's advice is if there is a way to build out a few POCs that enable me to prove out any of the above questions from the clients, and it doesn't take too long to do that, that is probably worth doing
	- Advantage of getting on the phone with people is that I can gauge PMF before I spend a lot of time building and continue to refine the idea
	- In the beginning, I can utilize mostly tools that already exist vs. having to build them all. As I start working with clients, I will become aware of gaps and have a better idea of what I want to build vs. trying to build solutions that already exist

### Action Items:
1. Work on services definition - what I would sell and how much it would cost
2. I need to create a top of funnel model to figure out how many people I need to close in order to hit these customer numbers, so it can be calculated automatically
	1. Update the model to the new plan/scenarios
	2. Create a highly successful model in the optimistic scenario (what would this look like if this went really well?)
	3. Update the tax number to 25% from 45% in the model
	4. Terry: will share some more detailed tax analysis estimates with me for fed, state, individual tax rates
3. Write the value props, pitch deck/website wireframe
	1. Pick a target date where I am ready to make sales calls with people within my network
4. Make the outreach list to help me dial this concept in
	1. Who would I want to reach out to first (prioritization)?
5. When ready, set up the C-corp
