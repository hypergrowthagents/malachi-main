## Email Response

Hey Malachi,

Happy to geek out together..  I think the way you’re positioning yourself at the intersection of AI and Growth is exactly where a lot of need and opportunity exists right now. Happy to share some perspective on your questions:

**1. Where companies are investing $$ in AI right now**  
I’m seeing four big buckets of demand:

- **Workflow Automation (Internal Efficiency):** This is often the entry point — companies are overwhelmed by repetitive tasks (reporting, campaign ops, data analysis) and are willing to invest in “quick win” automations that save hours and scale across teams.
    
- **AI Transformation:** Larger orgs are starting to reimagine entire processes, org structures, and tech stacks to be AI-first. These projects are slower moving (culture + systems have to catch up), but they’re where budgets grow once small wins are proven.
    
- **Talent Gap / Expertise:** Companies realize they don’t have people internally who are fluent enough in AI to even know what’s possible, so they’re looking externally — fractional leads, consultants, or advisors to help shape a roadmap and execute.
    
- **AI-Enabled Services:** Agencies and consultants who can layer AI into what they’re already delivering (e.g., growth marketing, research, content, analytics) are getting traction because clients want to see how AI improves outputs they already buy.
    

The biggest pain point I’d phrase simply as: _“We know AI is important, but we don’t know where to start, how to prioritize, or how to adopt it without disrupting the business.”_ That’s where people are willing to pay for clarity, strategy, and execution.

**2. Platforms for building client-facing AI solutions**  
For most client builds I lean on **n8n** or **[Make.com](http://make.com/)** when the workflow is straightforward, repeatable, and needs to be visible/editable by non-engineers. They create artifacts that teams can pick up after me.

For more complex, scalable solutions, I’ll use **Replit (with Supabase, APIs, etc.)** or **Claude Code** — while CC is more self-serving, it's the best to get an MVP done quickly that you can then hand off to regular dev teams (with 80-90 % already done and have them add the finishing touches - this is where it's value really drives margins.

- MVPs of products where we _know_ we’ll scale, or
    
- Internal prototypes where I stay in the loop for maintenance.
    

The “sweet spot” for client handoff is still low-code orchestration platforms + clear documentation + human-in-the-loop adoption. That way they can build confidence and maintain the workflows without needing engineers.

Would love to keep jamming on this. Sounds like you’re at an inflection point where you could either spin up something of your own or slot into a team that needs a growth + AI leader. Either way, happy to swap notes and share what I’m seeing from both the venture and consulting sides.


## Discussion Topics for Wednesday Call (1pm PT)

### Core Agenda Items

**1. AugmentGrowth Vision Walkthrough**
- Present the end-to-end managed growth service concept
- Get feedback on positioning at the intersection of AI + Growth
- Discuss market timing and competitive landscape

**2. Market Validation - Managed Service vs. DIY Tools**
- **Key Hypothesis**: "Companies will trust and value having a growth expert backed by advanced AI systems more than standalone agent products, at least for now"
- Test assumption: AI agents aren't 100% reliable for major functional needs yet
- Validate: Clients prefer strategy + implementation + execution + analysis as a package
- Question: What's Jeff seeing in terms of client preference for managed vs. self-service AI solutions?

**3. Technical Implementation Strategy**
- How does Jeff handle technical builds for clients?
- Partnership with Toni or independent tech resources?
- Best places to find reliable AI implementation talent
- Tools/platforms working best for client handoffs (n8n, Make.com, Replit, Claude Code)

**4. Market Intelligence Review**
- Discuss Jeff's insights from his email on AI investment buckets:
  - Workflow automation (quick wins)
  - AI transformation (larger budgets, slower adoption)
  - Talent gap/expertise consulting
  - AI-enabled services overlay
- Pain point: "We know AI is important, but don't know where to start"

**5. Partnership Exploration**
- Scenarios where collaboration could work:
  - Jeff providing AI technical expertise for Malachi's growth clients
  - Malachi providing growth/marketing expertise for Jeff's AI clients
  - Joint AugmentGrowth service development
  - Referral partnership structure

### Follow-up Questions
- What's the typical engagement length and budget range for Jeff's AI consulting?
- Which client verticals are most receptive to AI-enabled growth work?
- What are the biggest failure points Jeff sees in AI implementation projects?
