### Personal Updates & Family

- Derek’s family situation
  - Heather quit her job recently but may return to work
  - Younger daughter Eva (turning 3 in November) just started preschool
  - Older daughter Riley in first grade, showing talent in drawing and crafts
 

### Derek’s Business Journey & Pivot

- Previous co-founder issues
  - Started AI/Salesforce configuration business 2.5 years ago
  - Co-founder (married to Heather’s friend) proved difficult to work with
  - Fired entire team in March due to irreconcilable working relationship
- Current business: Superframe
  - Pivoted from CRM to comprehensive activity/signal tracking
  - Goal: 360-degree view of all customer interactions (sales, support, marketing)
  - Freemium model inspired by Fireflies success (350k customers, 20M users)
  - Charge based on number of activities tracked
  - New co-founder joining with significant equity stake
  - Planning to raise couple million for restart

### AI-Enabled Growth Business Strategy

- Why AI-enabled solutions work better
  - Primary advantage: cheaper than traditional agencies
  - Can take on more clients with higher margins
  - AI enables the solution but can’t be the core value proposition
- Messaging challenges with guarantees
  - Performance guarantees are tricky because they’ve been promised before
  - Everyone markets performance-based solutions - message needs differentiation
  - Guarantees help conversion but won’t convince uninterested prospects

### Audience Targeting & Differentiation Strategies

- PostHog as model for audience-specific messaging
  - Doesn’t claim to be better than Segment - claims to be “FOR YOU” (engineers)
  - Desktop website design speaks directly to developer audience
  - Don’t need to differentiate value prop - can differentiate identity and communication style
- Sentry’s approach
  - Removed tracking pixels (audience hates being tracked)
  - Funds open source projects that align with target users
  - Better growth than performance marketing achieved
- Key principle: narrow market focus
  - Mode vs Tableau example: focused on people who already understood the difference
  - Avoid explaining differences - find people who already “get it”
  - Small markets acceptable for non-venture-funded individual consulting

### Customer Acquisition Focus & Market Validation

- Recommendation to narrow from broad “growth operations” to specific customer acquisition
- Most important strategic advice: intentionally narrow market
  - Find audience segment 100% consistent in desires and messaging preferences
  - Example: startups under 10 employees, $10k-$100k revenue, selling to technical audiences
- Market research approach
  - Talk to 25 people in target audience
  - Subsegment further based on consistent patterns
  - Look for technical founders without business/marketing experience
  - Derek offered Clay credits to help build prospect lists

### Implementation & Technical Approach

- Services-first strategy makes sense
  - Hedge against unproven agent capabilities
  - Build and perfect agents through real-world usage
  - Graduate proven agents to self-service tier
  - Human + AI model may be permanent viable approach
- Technical details less important than market fit
  - Focus 100% on what audience wants and will pay for
  - Delivery method (AI vs people in Estonia) doesn’t matter to customers
  - Startup audience good fit since they’re also finding their market

### Next Steps & Action Items

- Malachirose to complete
  - Write refined 1-2 page pitch for Derek’s feedback
  - Read “The Mom Test” (audiobook)
  - Conduct 25 customer interviews with target audience segmentation
  - Set up research call with Derek as potential client in 2 weeks
- Derek to send
  - “Wok” cookbook by Kenji Lopez-Alt
  - Support with Clay credits for prospect research when needed

Meeting Title: Derek / Malachi
Date: Sep 30
Meeting participants: Derek Steer (aka. "Them")

Transcript:
 

Them: All right. Now we're getting into your stuff. Why don't you. I'll give you my general answer, and then I'll give you, like, a more specific answer after you tell me what's on your mind, because I'm excited to hear. My general answer. So for me personally, I've learned through this that I'm like a team person. I cannot be alone alone. I need to be working with other people. Whether they are a co founder and employee is a different story. And I'm, like, a much bigger believer in, like, employees now than co founders. But it's also a matter of how much you need to comp somebody in order to get them to join. When you have no customers and no product or anything.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: So the reality of that is that you're often giving stuff away. I would under no circumstances split equity evenly, ever. The CEO job is so much harder. And I could refer you to a million people who have done the CEO job and other co founding or executive jobs. They'll tell you the same thing. Being the CEO is orders of magnitude harder. And you go down with the ship like everyone else has choices about what they're doing with their lives. You don't. There's also a lot of benefit that the CEO gets. To. But the reality is, because the CEO is so tied to the business, and the business really cannot succeed. In a lot of cases with, like, CEO transitions, Like the CEO should get paid more, should have outsized decision making power. And I think importantly, you can't have a decision making partnership. And I really feel strongly about this right. Like the reality of business decisions is if you just unilaterally applied force to every decision, no one will want to work with you. And so you can't do that realistically. But when there is some kind of tiebreaker, it needs to be understood in the business. That the CEO is the person whose ass is on the line. And they make the final call.  
Me: So you're not paralyzed in any situation.  
Them: And you really need. Buy in. From whoever else is on the team. So the situation that is the worst possible situation is two co founders split the equity 50 50. It just creates so much ambiguity about who as the final say. And it really needs to be understood that when you disagree, one person has the final say.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I have been like thinking about that because I think I also work better with other people. But recently, AI has been a pretty interesting co founder. Funny enough. I don't know if it's exactly the same. It's very different experience.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But you can have, like, a war room meeting every day, every hour. And every minute and just go through things and get challenged or get supported or whatever you are needing. It can provide, which is a fascinating spot.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: To be in. So recently, yeah, I've just had, like, clawed, essentially, as my co founder. And we'll see if that's good or bad. But it is. Claude shows up every day. And works hard as long as I'm there too.  
Them: Dude. I'm a big believer. Okay, so tell me what's going on. So it sounded when you read, first of all. By the way. I have your phone number still. And you do not need to sign your texts to me. You can just one line or. Hey, man, what's up? And you will always be able to do that, Malachi.  
Me: For sure. Vitti. It was. I don't know, dude. You never know when someone loses their phone or changes their phone number and doesn't spray it out. So since I hadn't chatted with you in a while,  
Them: Always. Okay? I will. New phone. Who this to you?  
Me: You got the courtesy initial Malachi. And there will be no further ones.  
Them: But I appreciate that. I'm just telling you. That you will never be a stranger.  
Me: For sure. Same.  
Them: But, yeah, it seemed like you were, like, considering starting, or possibly have already started a company. So what's going on? What's the idea? What's the market? How far are you?  
Me: I'm early. So I only left Maven a couple weeks ago. Like three weeks ago, something like that.  
Them: Congrats.  
Me: Thanks. And I had spent the previous few months leading up to that. Just deep dive into AI really just thinking about all the different ways that it could be applied. I was upskilling myself. Like, frankly, I needed to. I. Although I've been so deep in AI, there was still a gap that existed between my knowledge of it and, like, how to make it applicable, how to actually, like, build with it. And so there was just some amount of like, ok, I need to get in there and fucking work with these machines and decide if this is something I want to do. Or if I need to hire people that can go out and build these things. Or wear. Essentially, the ceiling was. And I'm giving you more, like, the backstory than what I'm doing currently.  
Them: I'm interested.  
Me: Yeah. And each phase.  
Them: Well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna carry you outside. Someone just dropped off my food, so I'm gonna go out and grab it. Here. But I'm. I'm listening to you. And then I'm gonna not eat it, but I am gonna sit down at a proper table so I can.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Like, focus up.  
Me: Yeah, no worries. At each stage of that, I was kind of, like, usually surprised at the positive that I could do more with it. Than I thought I could do. And I would. I would have to go through some degree of struggle, research or just technological breakthrough on the product side. Where suddenly there's a capability that makes it easier. For, like a layman to do something that previously felt like an engineering task. And I was like, cool. This is fucking awesome. I was, like, having the time in my life. But I kind of realized. That that was not going to be permanently viable. Focus. For me at Maven, like we were just, frankly, just too small. Of a company to have one of the two, like, execs off fucking around with AI. The whole time. And.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So I knew that's where I wanted to spend my time and energy is like, how do I wrap up all of my years of experience in growth and in marketing? And connect it to this paradigm shift. That is occurring in AI because I either have to suffer through it at Maven, where we have to take our business model down to zero and rebuild again for an AI age type of thing. Which was going to be interesting, maybe, if it's even viable to do that. Given like the cost structure of an existing business. Or start something new. And so now seemed like the right time for me to explore this. My original idea that I had, which I've evolved a bit, was like, starting out by trying to build an agent platform. Something where I have a bunch of fine tuned agents for growth needs that solve specific pain points that you or anybody else could essentially go in there. And leverage for discrete tasks, whether it's like customer research. Or it's performance marking analysis or so on. And as I spend more time thinking about it, I was like, I shouldn't build a software. Platform. Like I don't know anything about building software platforms. That's gonna be a long time before I have something that's consumer facing and ready. And I frankly need to make money in between now and that point in the distant future. As well as just so many risks that exist in that type of model, including me just trying to build stuff and hope that there's a market for it. And so I kind of, like, swung back over to the idea of how do I approach something that leverages my skill set and knowledge initially with more of a services. Approach. So I could come in and do some form of, like, growth marketing for companies. And begin to build the architecture layer. For some of these agents behind the scenes. Dog fooding at myself. Using it to initially be like a superpowered IC in growth marketing. And getting to the point where I actually have things. Either mostly autonomous or fully autonomous TBD in the future, it actually does not matter. I think there's like, a business model that exists where it's humans plus AI in perpetuity. And then there's probably some things where you're just like, AI's good enough. I'm trusted to do this thing. And I don't need to have a person doing anything other than, like, prompting it. Initially to get it going. And so I have already purchased a domain. I'm calling it Augment Growth. AI and thanks, ma'am. And initially, I want to lean a little bit more into the de risking the use of AI.  
Them: I like that.  
Me: Within growth.  
Them: I kind of like. By the way, I kind of like augmented intelligence as well. I feel like Apple got, like, a lot of eye rolls when they're like, AI stands for Apple Intelligence. But I actually think, like, conceptually, it's kind of like a nice play to do that. Anyway, sorry. Continue.  
Me: No, all good. And so, yeah, like I said, I've been going back and forth. With my business partner, Claude. And essentially just building out the plan. Initially, my game plan was, like, I was just gonna start building. I just wanted to go straight into build mode. Because I needed to kind of prove to myself that I could ship fast. I've been, like, so much in educating myself and using these things and not enough in building that I'm, like, a little bit at a dearth of proving out exactly what the ceiling is on these capabilities. But in talking to people, I quickly realized, like, that's probably not a smart thing for me to do. That was the temptation. But that I should instead, like, spend at least a little bit of energy thinking about what I'm trying to build towards, whether it's viable, who it's serving, what the pain points are just the obvious shit that everyone should be doing. If they're thinking about starting something up. And if at the end of this, I decide there's no business model here and I should just go work for another company, Leading growth that xyz startup. Or scaled company, so be it. But I essentially gave myself a window of time. To prove this out. And see what I. What would make sense. And so in my current iteration of this that I've been refining is, like, really trying to laser in on customer acquisition. As a pain point, because this is where I think you don't have to convince people what the impact is of, like, any sort of automation. Or use of AI this is gonna generate revenue. For you. And it's also where my skill set is, so I could. Viably actually know what to build. Against this. And so I won't tell you all the different versions that I thought of that kind of went into this point. But yeah, I'm kind of like, thinking about. Okay, so I've got this company called Augment Growth. Initially, it starts out a data is like AI augmented services business. Where I could just iterate with trying to give as many things to AI as possible. Along the way. And so early stage, it's not that differentiated from, like, an agency. But over time, because it's AI first. The way I would build this out would not be the way I would build out. An agency. I went just, like, hire a ton of bodies or offshore this shit to the Philippines or some of these things. I'd be building out, like, teams of specialized agents that can do these things, and that's just gonna be a totally different. Place to be starting than an agency that has a specific cost structure that's unable to do some of these things. And my long term vision. Would be to over the period of X number of months or who knows, year, or whatever it takes for me to kind of get to this point, it's probably like over a year. Is move this towards a platform. Whereby, let's say, you and your company, if you were in my target, you would be able to utilize the same capabilities that I have built up and run it yourself with, like, minimal. Effort. Like you do not have to be a specialist in marketing or growth to do it. But that it does require, and probably should have, a certain amount of steering. And oversight involved in just like. Yes, this all makes sense. I don't wanna. I don't wanna hand over the keys to the robots yet.  
Them: What would be? What are you looking for from me? In this conversation, I mean.  
Me: I think there's, like, one of the things I have that's kind of specific to you. Is thinking about the technical aspect of building something like what I'm trying to build. I think you have. In2 domains. In analytics and in engineering, you have vastly more experience. Than I do and probably more domains than that, including entrepreneurship and running companies and stuff. But I think I'd be really interested to know where you see red flags. Or problems. Tied to some tied to this concept or where you get excited by the opportunity. And I'd love to know the technical viability. Of. Let's just say you were in my shoes and you were planning to build out a lot of AI automation. Would you attempt to do a lot of that yourself? Or would you say, like, look, there's no way I would do this without a founding cto. And check for a million dollars from Pre Seed Venture or something.  
Them: Okay? First of all. A big advocate of betting on yourself. And I. I want you to know that in the same way that you, like, don't need to sign your texts, I will always be here to support you, making a bet on yourself if you get, like, lonely and you know, Claude is not enough of a partner for you and you want to, like, cowork with. Me for a little bit. I'm down. If you want to just, like, bounce off, I'm always here, so just know that, like, it's hard. It doesn't always feel hard because it feels fun. It's fun at, like, a lot of the time, but someone's hard. It's really hard. Lonely. And, like, I've been through that, and I'm here. So good for you.  
Me: I really appreciate that.  
Them: And like it. Yeah, you. You got to have. You got to have people in your corner. I even found through my experience. That, like, Heather, the person closest to me in the world, did not get it, and I couldn't not talk to her about these things, but she just, like, had never had a degree of professional responsibility that was equivalent to what I had. And it just was killing me. My sleep was bad. Whatever. Anyway. You're not there yet. Right now you're in the fun stage.  
Me: Well, I mean, that resonates with me. Like, I can't really talk in depth about these ideas with Danielle. She does not care and only sees the problems in it and not the opportunities with it. And so I seek her opinion when I wanna know the problem. S. I guess.  
Them: Well, let me, let me tell you about. So, so I'll give you like a quick two minute mode story here that'll like, maybe you can communicate this to Danielle in some way that they'll help her understand it. So, like, Mode ultimately is a financial failure. Like we though, I got the company up to almost 40 million in revenue, and we sold it for a headline $200 million. We sold it to a company that is private and probably is underwater, too. And it's like unlikely to ever have a liquidity event. So my emote equity is effectively worth $0. I did not make anything. And that whole time I was earning a depressed salary. Like I would have made much more money just continuing to work at Microsoft after the Emir acquisition. For 10 years, especially with what their stock did. Right. So in that sense, financially disastrous decision. However, by virtue of being the CEO of Mode, I had the opportunity to invest early in a number of companies, some of which had paid off huge. You know, to the point where, like, we just did a massive remodel on our house, and, like, my buddy's company paid for it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: When you sort of commit to this direction and start to find success. Your station. I mean, like, look, you thought to call me because. Of my experience running mode. If I'd stayed at Microsoft, you wouldn't be calling me about this.  
Me: I'd be like, fuck that guy. I don't want his opinion.  
Them: No, I mean, like, look, I'd also have worse opinions because one of the things people ask me about being a CEO is when it was harder than other jobs. Yes, in some ways, yes. But in terms of, like, the actual decision making, the way in which, like, it's easier, is that you have a specific job. To keep track of everything. And so like it should follow that the CEO in a large company anyway. As the best grasp of like the future of the company and what's happening across the board. Because literally their job, if you have a different job, it is hard to both do your job and have that kind of like cross departmental, more long term, you know, industry and market oriented purview. So, like, part of it also is just, like, by putting yourself in a position to care about different stuff. You make yourself, in a lot of ways, more valuable to the broader market, even if you just go back into, like, a growth marketing role somewhere. But by virtue of having run a business, even if it is like a solo consultancy, you have, you have gained invaluable skill.  
Me: This was my thought exactly, by the way, was like, what is the downside to me. Spending a couple of months really trying to set something up here, even if it just ends up being a discussion point for some future interview or something. Which I wouldn't say is my success date, but that could be some version instead of me reaching out and deciding I wanna have a conversation with a company that I wanna have a job with. For all I know, I could just end up having a bunch of different discussions with potential clients, and those could turn into opportunities in their own right.  
Them: Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I think you're right.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So.  
Me: Yeah. Please continue.  
Them: So my thoughts on your. On your actual thing. So at a broad level, right, like, business success is about providing a thing to a market that the market wants. And ideally, that is not currently being served right. And that's the way that you can premium price. You know this stuff, right? But, like, I usually think it bears repeating. Because a lot of people get excited about a technology or whatever it is, and they, like, lose sight of what the market actually needs. So the real like there are companies that are buying AI. For the sake of AI. And it's driven by executives who feel pressure to aiify. From someone else. But at the end of the day, Like no one cares. You're either acquiring customers or you aren't, whether you're using AI or not. Right? And so for you, like, as a person who wants to provide an AI enabled solution, My thought anyway is like, okay, well, what does that mean in concrete terms, right? Like, if someone is doing something already to acquire customers, why is like, the AI enabled solution better? And like, the best answer that I can think of, honestly, is that it's cheaper, right? Like, what can you do that a traditional agency that has tons of headcount cannot do? You can underprice them.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: Or you can have fewer clients. And take a higher margin. Right. Like, but the answer is that there is an economic benefit to it. So that's, that's, like, the first thing that I would say is, like, you, you should figure out where the value prop is going to be and what types of companies want to buy that specific value prop. I want to buy it in the form that you're going to provide it. So, you know, that's. That, to me, is the exercise for you at this moment is. What is it? Who buys it and why do they buy it instead of your competitors? Right. And like AI cannot be the answer to any of that. AI is simply a thing that enables it to happen.  
Me: Yep. Totally agree.  
Them: And I would, like, write those things down and try to make them so clear that, like, Danielle can articulate them to her friends at parties and stuff.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: And then you reinforce them in all the ways that you know how to do. As someone who is a marketing expert, Right.  
Me: Yeah. And my thought is that it would be cheaper, faster. And better, which seems impossible. But that, I think, is a rewriting of the equation that's happening a bit.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And it kind of puts me in a position where I'm thinking, initially, I would actually tie it to a performance guarantee, which isn't something I would typically do. For an agency, that's a little risky. But I think if I can set this up correctly, I could essentially say I'm confident I could come in and deploy these systems. I'll just use broad term system. In a way that initially reduces your cac. And once I've proven that out, I'm gonna move off of that model. And actually conform to some sort of scalable model that exists today that's just cheaper than what you're currently paying.  
Them: So this is reminding me. I'm going to give you some good news and bad news. The good news, as you've correctly identified, is that things that draw a straight line to revenue, it's typically pretty easy to talk about the value. Right. Like to say, I will get you more customers for less money is, like, so concrete that in theory, that should be a very straightforward discussion. Of course. Here, take it right. I worked with this company.  
Me: But it raises questions of.  
Them: That.  
Me: How. And is this legit? And you gotta believe the vision.  
Them: Well. Yes. And the specific, the reason that that's a problem? Is because the promise has been made before.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I've got this buddy who runs a company called Try now and they do like a Try before you buy cart for shopify businesses. So you, you know, you get all the stuff. It doesn't charge your credit card. And then like, after 30 days, you get charged with stuff you don't send back. So it's very similar to stitch fix. And so their value prop, they can, like, very commute. They have customer case studies where they're like, listen. Across our entire customer base. We increase average order volume by this much. We increase conversion rate by this much, and the numbers are great. You look at these numbers and you're like, why would I not do this? Right. And the answer is everyone is marketing conversion based stuff to shopify businesses with the exact same types of claims. So. You need to find a message. That is not the same.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Even if the value prop is the same.  
Me: Yeah, I kind of agree. I'm, like, looking at this concept of a guarantee and deciding how much I wanna lean into it. It's kind of proven that guarantees are helpful in the conversion process, but it's probably not like, the linchpin. The thing that sells somebody who wouldn't otherwise. Wanna buy what you're offering? Is just to try and get them over the hump. That they love, they would wanna buy this anyway. And if they were on the fence, this is the thing that pushes them over that. That's at least how I think about it.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because I think you're right. It feels like a little bit of an overstatement or a lie. Or a little thirsty, to say the least. To set it up that way. And so I think that's, like, one element I'm trying to think through is, like, the role of a guarantee. But to your point, more importantly, it's more like, what are all the other pieces? That we're trying to actually set up here. What are the problems that I have that aren't just like that? I'm not getting guaranteed performance? That wasn't why I talked to you.  
Them: Well. Let me. Okay, so, I mean, this is my nudge you in a slightly different direction.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Have you seen? Do you know post hog?  
Me: Yep. We almost worked with them and. Yeah, anyway, go ahead.  
Them: Have you seen? There. So Post Hog is a company that, like, understands their audience super fucking well, right? By the way, their website right now is so sick.  
Me: Yeah, they're great. They're super funny.  
Them: It's one of the coolest pieces of marketing. Well, have you been to their website recently?  
Me: A few months ago.  
Them: Like, go check it out. I think it has changed in a few months. It is now. When you go to their website, it's like a desktop. It's a computer desktop.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And it's so detailed all the way down to. If you just leave the window open for a while, a screensaver will pop up. It is insane.  
Me: Yeah, that's funny.  
Them: And, like, who's their audience? It's engineers. Like this gets implemented by engineers at tiny companies. Who vibe with an irreverent brand. They don't want to talk to salespeople. Which is why that campaign on the buses is so good. Right. Like post hog just like gets their audience all the way. And when I think about how you might differentiate your message from other people that are making performance claims, One way to do it is audience specific. It can actually have nothing to do with performance at all. Right. Like Post Hog does not claim to be better than segment in any way. They claim to be for you as that startup developer. And, like, if there's an audience that you, like, know super duper well, like, let's say it's other growth people, right? And it's like you're the first growth person in the company and you need help that you haven't learned how to do this AI shit yourself yet or. You don't have the headcount or whatever. I'm the guy who gets you and I can come in. But like, if you figure out it could be a type of company, it could be a Persona within the company, there are a lot of ways in which you could identify some submarket and especially as like a non venture funded individual who might start in like. A consulting basis here, which I think is the right way to do it. You give yourself the opportunity to pick whatever audience you want. There's no such thing as a market that is too small for you at the moment. So that would be my suggestion is you don't necessarily have to differentiate your value prop. You can differentiate your identity. And the way that you communicate with your audience. By the way, I think Century. I think Century is another great example of this. Like, I don't know if you've seen their billboards, but their builders are, like, fucking stupid and ridiculous.  
Me: Here's some advice. Yeah. Make fun of their little veiny ass eyeball in the pyramid. It looks like it's actually struggling. It's really having a hard time.  
Them: Well, yeah. So I talked to their founder, and he said, so they got rid of the pixel on their website. Which their audience loves because it's all engineers who don't want to be pixeled. They took a lot of the market there, the money that they were putting into performance marketing, and started funding open source projects that vibe with the type of people who would want to be buying their software. Crushing it. Better growth than they've seen. And obviously you can't correlate it directly in the same way that marketers always want to do where they're like, I did this and use my conversion from this specific campaign. But what matters is the growth was leveling off and now it's up again.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: There's just, like, entirely different approaches that I think are worth considering.  
Me: What do you think about the whole idea of, like, building behind the scenes so I'm. I'm, like, forced to dog food it myself? I have my. My logic here. Is that it just in terms of, like, how capable agents are, they're still kind of early days. Like, some of them are impressive, but most of them are essentially unproven. It's not plug and play. I'd be a little hesitant to, like, want to build an entire business model on the back of agents, especially multiple of them. So my way to hedge that. Is to essentially say, like, initially using myself. But, like, let's say I am the interface. And I'm building these agents, or maybe at some point in the future, hiring people that help me build some of these agents. And I'm perfecting them. And I'm just going through, like, iteration cycles. With real world usage and data and getting these things to a place where I feel like they're really kicking ass before they get essentially graduated up into this other tier. Which is like, hey, anybody could use this agent. It could be like a thirty dollar an hour person out of Eastern Europe, or it could be me, but like essentially with a little steering. That's how it go.  
Them: Totally. Okay. This, I think, is the most important piece of advice I can possibly give you. None of that matters. These are details. They are not actually important. Okay. Are you familiar with rb2b?  
Me: R b to b.  
Them: Yeah, like the letters. The company. RB2B. Adam Robinson. Do you know who that is?  
Me: His name sounds familiar.  
Them: He is a LinkedIn personality. He is great at viral LinkedIn posts. Figured out that he can build a really big audience that way. He has hundreds of thousands of LinkedIn followers now. Just post and clickbaity shit. And after developing a following, basically use that following to determine what product he should provide and then build like a MeToo product. It's not even good product, right? And the expose have come out later about how it's a bad product. But he's got a lot of customers. And he's making more than 10 million in revenue. Bootstrapped. By building an audience and then figuring out what they want. Ed and I can't impress upon you enough. How important. If you figure out what it is. What it is that a particular audience really wants and is willing to pay for the way in which you deliver it. Is up to you. If they want cheaper customer acquisition and you can deliver it with AI, that's fine. If you can deliver it with people in Estonia, that's also fine. The people don't care. Like, 100% of your effort. Should go into what's the way to do that? And as I think about this, It's like, okay, well, what are you doing right now? Right? You are trying to find your market. And you're going to use AI. Right. In doing that, you might very well discover. Ways to find a market using AI, right? If you're doing it for yourself, maybe you could do it for other people. That suggests that the startup audience is a good place for you, because those are the types of companies that are looking to find a market. Right. Now, and they also happen to be here.  
Me: Yeah, I think they are. My probably my audience is like, fairly early stage companies.  
Them: Yeah. But there's like a size right where that's the problem for a super frame type of company. But that's not the problem for Mode. At the end of our life, we understood our market. Anyway, I would literally, if I were you, write down. A prompt for yourself, that is. What can I get people to pay for? Who's going to pay for it? What are they going to pay? And then every single question about AI is the post script to that. It's. Like, you know, if I can just get someone to say yes. Then I can worry about how I serve it too long.  
Me: Well, that's kind of what led me to the customer acquisition angle, because my previous version was like, let's call it growth operations, like a platform that did a whole ton of different things in a broader umbrella of growth. But I kind of, as I was thinking through it was like, who am I selling this to and what do they really want? And need. And you could get into a lot of arguments with yourself about the validity of these things. So, like, and as an example, I've built. I actually have this. But, like, I've built the ability to, like, predict whether or not we'll succeed or fail. In advance of ever having even made it or run it. Online. Which I thought would be, like, a cool experiment, and honestly, I don't know if it's accurate or not. Like, it could. It. It could probably divorce itself from, like, the true metrics in a lot of ways, but that was almost, like, not even the point. And, you know, that's like an example.  
Them: Well, the point is that if you can predict whether an ad will succeed or fail, then you can then build a thing that makes ads that will succeed.  
Me: Yeah. Or you. At the very least, you can remove shit that you probably shouldn't even begin with. From that equation, which is the other half of the same. The same thing, which is why I wanted to focus on that. And like, that's an example of a broader platform. Approach, but, like, are people willing to pay money for that? I don't know. Maybe not. Like there's no proven market. For a tool like that in existence, other than maybe like one that I've seen that tells you the psychological factors, and this may make a couple million dollars a year. On that of, like, ads. So my thought was, like, this is an existing market. It's a large market. It's one I know. It's one that I can. I'm sure I could develop a positioning angle. Against and a technology angle against. And so I'm kind of in the. The period, the point in time where I'm like, trying to just refine those pieces because I don't have to prove to that market exists. Or as large necessarily. It is crowded, but it's not yet crowded. With, like, the type of company I'm trying to build. That's fairly new.  
Them: What you have. I mean, what you have to prove is that you can get a piece of it. And what I would say is like, yes, the market is large, but to the extent that you think that, you're probably thinking about too big of a market. Right. You just stand to benefit so much from intentionally narrowing your market? Down to people for whom and, like, this is, like, I think, you know, marketing principles that you understand. But I think this is the stuff that I, as a startup founder, think of as, like, the most important thing is here's a good mode example, okay? So in the early days mode, like, we would pitch mo to people, and there were a lot of people who'd be like, how is this different from tedla? Then there were people who would look at it and they'd be like, oh, my God, finally. Something that works this way instead of how tableau works.  
Me: They were looking for that exact thing. That you had. Yep.  
Them: Yeah. Right. The way that we market to these two audiences is very different. Okay? Like if we. We could build a whole website and all our materials and everything around explaining our differences to tableau. Or we can make it. We could take the Persona that already understands the difference, and we can just write to them. So that when they land on this thing, they're like, oh, I found it. This is my home. Right. It turned out that the ladder was way more effective, always.  
Me: For sure.  
Them: And the biggest struggles we had. The ultimate problem with Moden, the reason that I'm not like on a fucking island somewhere drinking a daiquiri right now is that there just weren't enough people for a venture scale business. To who, like, immediately got that? Right. And the businesses that tend to have the biggest, biggest appeal are the ones where people immediately, there's a. There's a huge audience who immediately understand how it's different. This is like Uber versus Taxicab, right? It's like, just so you use it one time, you're like, of course, absolutely. And by the way, it's like, the reason that Waymo is going to crush Uber is, like, as soon as you ride in Waymo, you're like, oh, the driver is the problem.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Anyway, I'm like. I'm like, you know, I'm rambling now, but I think. Every time you talk to me about this, I will push you to narrow. Like narrow, narrow, narrow. Until you have a message where there's a small set of people who, when they see it, they're like, yes, that 100%. You could make a website for yourself that says, my name is Malachi and I help find the target market for startups with under 10 employees who have like, between 10k and 100k in sales. Who sell to technical audiences like you could literally just go do that. And I think it would be very successful.  
Me: Yeah. Good push. Since I know this kind of running along, do you think I could send you a pitch? I want to take you some of your advice. Refine it into like a one or two pager. Send it your way. And see if you think I should narrow in or continue to push in any specific angles. Anything like that.  
Them: Yeah, of course. I love this stuff.  
Me: Let me do that as a next step. And I may take you up on. On another sounding board in the near future, too, because your feedback's insanely valuable, man. Thank you. It's like, it's really. It's really useful, and it resonates with things I'm thinking about as well.  
Them: I hope so.  
Me: So I just need to find some of these and, like, probably just implement them a little bit better. And I'm also, yeah, in need of, like, actually putting some of these things down. Into a more refined written pitch. So. So you could, like, see concretely, like, what resonates and what doesn't.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, look, if I could give you a homework assignment, it would be to go talk to, like, 25 folks that you think are in your audience and then subsegment them even more.  
Me: And let's go from there.  
Them: Right, so. Like, if you think that it's tiny startups that are your audience. Maybe. Like starts where the founders all have a particular background. Like only technical founders. No business founder, right? Only technical founders. Maybe they don't have experience in marketing. They want. They think they need this and they need it in this way. Like, you're just looking for the consistencies, right? Like, you take your audience and then, like, you subsegment it until you find, like, one segment that have certain attributes that is 100% consistent in their desires and the way that they want to be messaged to. Like, if you find that. You're going to be great. The rest of it will flow naturally.  
Me: Yeah. Finding those 25 conversations is the. Is a little bit the tricky part when you're trying to get into market segmentation. Just in that it takes, like. Takes a little legwork when you don't have, like, a steady flow of these customers coming in the door. For you just to email. It'd be like, can you have a conversation with me?  
Them: Yeah, man. Yeah, well, do that.  
Me: Yeah, but it's. It is initially. I'm starting to talk with people just in my orbit. Who probably have, like, a more diverse background than, like, the sub segment. But even that, I think, is gonna probably surface some, like, early issues. And then I need to get into a little bit more of, like, the discrete market you're talking about. I would go straight to that if I had a fast way to do it. Or knew exactly what that. That market looks like. And that's probably. Yeah, that's probably my next step is just to figure that out.  
Them: Yeah. Figure out what the small market is, and then you can go buy data. I mean, it's, like, pretty cheap. You can get, like, you. You can just use. You know what? If you have, like, a particular thing you want me to look up, I'll just, like, use my clay credits for you. And, like, put together a list of companies that match that description, and then you can just go through LinkedIn and see how you can get to them and get personal interest. Or I mean. I find investors to be, like, pretty good at this stuff. If you know any vcs, I don't know. Like. Yeah. Get an idea of what you. Of what you think it could be. And I can help you, you know, find specific, like, companies and ways into them. But, you know, people generally, I think, are willing to give information, right? If you're. If it's not like a pitch, that's like, hey, I'm starting a new thing and I'm learning. Have a conversation, help me out. I think people are pretty good. And, you know, if you deliver, if you listen to them, And then like, you're like, hey, I listen to you. I heard this is what you want. Here's a proposal. Are you interested? Then you like? No, for sure. Have you read the mom test?  
Me: No, I haven't read the bomb test.  
Them: Good book. Should you read it? It's the. The, like tagline for it is like. This is, like, the way to get around the fact that everyone will lie to you.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Look, when you pitch someone something without actually asking them to pay for it, they will tell you it's good just to get you to go away. You know this, right? I'm sure you do. I do this to people. Everyone does this to people, right? Oh, yeah, it's great.  
Me: Yeah, so you can get some bias in the results.  
Them: Good luck. Yeah.  
Me: Cool. Well, that's good. That's good, too. Well, all you eat your lunch at this point, and then how about we just regroup? When I'm a little bit more to show on this. And then on the flip side, if there's anything at all that I could do for free for you. And what you're working on. Let me know. Happy to return the favor and help out if you want. If you want a website review or you need some help with thinking through some element of your business. Happy to to support.  
Them: Dude. Use me for research. Not right this second, but, like, let's in two weeks. Let's do, like, a research call where you can figure out what my problems are. And like, add me to your list of potential clients. I am a company that needs customers and has money. Get the info from me.  
Me: You. What's your deeds?  
Them: I can pay you.  
Me: Um, yeah. Totally. Are you not at the point where you're doing paid acquisition? Right.  
Them: No. And we probably will do stuff a little bit differently, but we should talk about it. I mean, like.  
Me: Yeah. I mean.  
Them: Like. I have some ideas about how I want to go to market, but I think you can help me.  
Me: For sure. And like I said, I'm. I'm happy to do some, like, free stuff, just as a friend. Too. And if you have, like, bigger needs, then. Oh, this is only going for you. I'm not offering this to everybody.  
Them: Stop that. I understand that, and I appreciate it, but. But, like, dude. Customers are valuable. If you're going to find people who are paying me money, I should pay for it. It doesn't matter if we're friends. I appreciate it.  
Me: No, I totally get it. And I would have no hesitation in asking for that, too, if we were getting into, like, the. Into the depths of stuff.  
Them: Good.  
Me: So. Yeah, it's cute. Let's keep things flowing in terms of this discussion and, yeah, thanks.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Ma'am. Super. Appreciate it.  
Them: I'm so glad to talk to you.  
Me: Same. Same. It's good to hear about your family and say hi to Heather from it.  
Them: Yeah, me too. We'll do and hide it to Daniel and the kids.  
Me: I. I have to see your house at some point. It looks. Looks dope from the brief couple tours I've gotten.  
Them: Oh, yeah, thanks. Well, here, I'll show you. Actually, I'll show you the thing that I think you'll really be into.  
Me: The remodel.  
Them: Yeah, all the stuff in here is pretty. Is, like, pretty new, like, all the finishes and stuff, but the.  
Me: I was gonna say that doesn't look like an old house from that neighborhood.  
Them: No, it's not. Well, our house was kind of modern to begin with, but the thing that we did that's, like, extra special is we did this built in. And there's a TV. So this is a 65 inch TV behind those doors. And then in these little, like these gray things are hiding speakers. So it's like a fully concealed, like. Theater level.  
Me: Is that? What is that? Is that a desk or a living room or what?  
Them: Experience. This is a. This is the living room. Yeah. So this is the front door is, like, right here, and this is, like, two upstairs, and then the living room in the front of the house.  
Me: Uh. Oh, I didn't see the couch. For some reason, I thought that was, like, the background of the desk.  
Them: Yeah. That's where I was sitting initially. So, like, when I go. I was just, like, sitting on the couch, and I go over to the couch here. You can kind of see the. In the background, the rest of the house. I don't think you've been here, huh? The house here. I'll just go all the way to the edge. So, like, the house is, like, one room? Basically, there's, like, no hallways. Right? There's like this little tiny hallway at the back, and then an office back there. And there's like three rooms upstairs. It's. It's like not a big. It's like whatever. 2,300 square foot house is not a huge house by any means. Big for San Francisco. But it, like, feels big because it's all just in one space.  
Me: Yeah. You have that big open wall. With the painting on it. We had a. When we were in Soma, we had the loft with that big wall and I could put the huge painting on.  
Them: Oh, yeah. It's fun. Yeah.  
Me: Now I have that same exact painting, but on a little wall. And it's like. It's basically like a floor to ceiling painting. It's pretty funny.  
Them: We did. We have, like, one, like, a pretty big thing that we moved to our bathroom.  
Me: We're just going for it.  
Them: But yeah, man. Well, we'll get you out here, too. You know, I think especially with, like, you know, kids who are past the. Mac and cheese only type of stage. It's, like, easier to.  
Me: Speak for yourself. My kids, my Sienna loves Mac and cheese, but she'll only do the box Trader Joe's kind. So don't try and spring any fancy shit on her. She wants to do that.  
Them: Do something together. Mark Our kids also like Mac and cheese, but they will eat other. If you want to come over and I'll make a Mac and cheese. We'll do. I'll cut some hot dogs up and do the whole.  
Me: Chef Flirty over here.  
Them: Thing. Yeah.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I like to cook. That's my new thing. I really like to cook. I cook almost every night.  
Me: Sam. I'm like, the main chef in the house.  
Them: I feel like you had a talent for this always.  
Me: I don't know if I did, but I have expanded the palette and can even cook Asian food. Pretty damn well now. And that's actually mostly what I'm making these days. Now that I've unlocked that, I'm like, fuck, yeah. Let's make some tie. Let's do some Chinese. It's like, turns out it's a pretty healthy way to eat if you cook it right away.  
Them: Like. Did you have you read Walk?  
Me: No.  
Them: It's kenshi lopez alts. It's just a great. Cookbook. For Asian, like stir fries and all that kind of stuff.  
Me: I have a few. These are the mostly using. Like chatgpt, like a custom GPT I made that can crank out some vegan. Type of recipes and stuff. It's pretty cool.  
Them: Are you vegan? Now.  
Me: We have become, like, 95% vegan. So 5% of the time we will eat whatever we want, including, like I just said, bacon wrapped scallops in Boston and stuff. Like, it's whatever. But yeah, when we choose to cook or otherwise, like, we're usually choosing vegan or at least vegetarian.  
Them: Good for you. What's your address?  
Me: 89. Woodland wag. W o d l a n d way piedmont.  
Them: Yeah. Oakland, okay? Micro. Okay, great.  
Me: Nine, four, six is one.  
Them: I'm gonna send you a copy of Walk.  
Me: Nice. Dude. Now I'm going to be forced to cook out of that book.  
Them: And the mall test.  
Me: If you overcome.  
Them: I'm gonna send you the mom test and walk. And you should read these things.  
Me: Don't send me mom test. I will get that in audiobook. Because that's how I consume most content these days. It's where I have. I'm doing dishes or cooking or something. So I'll just use an audible credit on that and we'll read it.  
Them: Okay? Great. Okay? Cool.  
Me: Thanks for the tip.  
Them: All right, man. Great talking to you. This was fun. Let's do it again. And I'll talk to you soon.  
Me: Sam.  
Them: All right.  
Me: All right. See you soon.  
Them: Bye.  
Me: Cb.
