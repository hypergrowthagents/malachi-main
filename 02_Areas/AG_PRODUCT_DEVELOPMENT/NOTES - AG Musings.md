- LEVERAGE: I need to find a path to making Augment a nearly 100% software solution at some point in order to scale, otherwise I’ll always be limited by my own time. I need to achieve a 70%+ margin.
- I can take on several consulting gigs in the meantime to pay the bills and buy myself time to figure out the platform. That helps solve the cash flow gap.
- I need to find a market that is worth over $1bn according to Michia Rohrssen, or $2bn if raising venture. So I need to find a big enough market with a high severity pain point that is currently underserved.

Potential Markets:
- Media agencies that are dying or being squeezed (but they’ll want to build it themselves perhaps)
- Fully automated customer acquisition ***
