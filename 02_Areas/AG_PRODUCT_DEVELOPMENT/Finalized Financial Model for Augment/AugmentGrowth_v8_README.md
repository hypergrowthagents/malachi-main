## Build Summary

Successfully built financial model v8 from scratch with:
- **5 sheets** (Executive Dashboard, Input Parameters, Sales Pipeline, Business Scaling, Monthly Cash Flow)
- **1,394 formulas** across all sheets
- **Zero formula errors** (validated with recalc.py)
- **Zero merged cells** (Google Sheets compatible)

---

## Sheet Overview

### 1. Executive Dashboard
**Purpose:** Quick summary for new viewers

**Key Metrics:**
- Scenario comparison table (Worst-Case, Conservative, Realistic, Optimistic)
- Month 12 metrics (clients, users, revenue by stream)
- Cash position & runway analysis
- Break-even timing by scenario
- Key assumptions summary
- Scenario descriptions

### 2. Input Parameters
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all assumptions

**Contains:**
- Personal financial situation ($108K cash, $28.3K expenses, $16.3K shortfall)
- Tax assumptions (45% rate = 55% net)
- Consulting pricing ($10K/month)
- Managed service pricing (10% of spend, spend scaling over time)
- Self-service pricing ($1K-1.2K ARPU)
- Cost assumptions (PM: $3K/month, Software: 3%)

**Note:** ALL formulas reference this sheet - no hardcoded values anywhere.

### 3. Sales Pipeline
**Purpose:** Convert acquisition targets into required sales activity

**Structure:**
Three independent funnels:
1. **High-Touch Consulting**
   - Forward Model (reference)
   - Backward Model (PRIMARY) → Row 20 feeds Business Scaling
   
2. **Managed Service**
   - Forward Model (reference)
   - Backward Models by scenario:
     - Conservative → Row 41
     - Realistic → Row 49
     - Optimistic → Row 57
   
3. **Self-Service Platform**
   - Forward Model (reference)
   - Backward Models by scenario:
     - Conservative → Row 79 (all zeros - no launch)
     - Realistic → Row 83 (M8 launch)
     - Optimistic → Row 89 (M6 launch)

**Key Feature:** Adjust client/user targets in Backward Model → automatically updates all scenarios.

### 4. Business Scaling
**Purpose:** Calculate revenue and costs by scenario

**Structure:**
Four scenarios (rows):
- **Worst-Case** (5-10): Zero income, shows runway
- **Conservative** (13-37): 3 consulting, 5 managed by M12, no self-service
- **Realistic** (40-64): 3 consulting, 7 managed, 23 self-service by M12
- **Optimistic** (67-91): 3 consulting, 9 managed, 50 self-service by M12

**Each scenario has:**
- Consulting Revenue (clients × $10K)
- Managed Service Revenue (clients × spend × 10%)
- Self-Service Revenue (users × ARPU)
- Total Gross Revenue
- Net Revenue (Gross × 55%)
- PM Costs (scales with client count)
- Software Costs (3% of gross)
- Total Business Expenses

**Key Rows for Reference:**
- Conservative Total Gross: Row 33
- Conservative Total Expenses: Row 37
- Realistic Total Gross: Row 60
- Realistic Total Expenses: Row 64
- Optimistic Total Gross: Row 87
- Optimistic Total Expenses: Row 91

### 5. Monthly Cash Flow
**Purpose:** Track cash position and identify break-even timing

**Structure:**
Four scenarios showing:
- Beginning Cash (Month 1 = $108K)
- Income (Danielle + Business Revenue post-tax)
- Expenses (Personal + Business)
- Net Cash Flow
- Ending Cash

**Break-Even Expectations:**
- Worst-Case: Never (6.6 month runway)
- Conservative: Month 6
- Realistic: Month 3
- Optimistic: Month 2

**Key Rows for Ending Cash:**
- Worst-Case: Row 11
- Conservative: Row 30
- Realistic: Row 48
- Optimistic: Row 66

## How to Use This Model

### Testing Scenarios

**To adjust client acquisition targets:**
1. Go to "Sales Pipeline" sheet
2. Find the Backward Model for the scenario you want to change
3. Update "Target: Consulting Clients Desired" or "Target: Managed Clients (Cumulative)"
4. Changes automatically flow to Business Scaling and Monthly Cash Flow

**To adjust pricing or costs:**
1. Go to "Input Parameters" sheet
2. Update the relevant assumption (consulting fee, managed %, ARPU, PM cost, software %)
3. All scenarios automatically recalculate

**To test "what-if" scenarios:**
1. Create a copy of the file
2. Adjust assumptions in Input Parameters or Sales Pipeline
3. Compare results across scenarios in Executive Dashboard

### Key Questions This Model Answers

1. **When do I break even?** → Monthly Cash Flow sheet, look for first positive Net Cash Flow
2. **How much runway do I have?** → Executive Dashboard or Monthly Cash Flow ending cash
3. **What's my Month 12 MRR?** → Executive Dashboard or Business Scaling Total Gross Revenue
4. **How many clients do I need to hit break-even?** → Adjust Sales Pipeline backward models
5. **What happens if self-service launches earlier/later?** → Change launch month in Sales Pipeline
6. **Can I afford to hire the offshore PM?** → Check Conservative/Realistic scenarios with 2+ clients

## Critical Model Features

### ✅ All Assumptions Parameterized
- No hardcoded values in formulas
- Everything references Input Parameters
- Easy to test different assumptions

### ✅ Three Revenue Streams
- Consulting (bridge income)
- Managed Service (core business)
- Self-Service (scale play)
- Each modeled independently

### ✅ Dynamic Cost Scaling
- PM cost appears when managed clients ≥ 2
- Software costs scale at 3% of revenue
- No fixed overhead

### ✅ Client Spend Scaling
- Months 1-2: $50K average
- Months 3-5: $65K average
- Months 6-12: $85K average
- Reflects both client growth and moving upmarket

### ✅ Self-Service Churn Modeling
- Conservative: No launch
- Realistic: M8 launch, 20-25 users by M12
- Optimistic: M6 launch, 50 users by M12
- Churn rates decrease over time (20% → 10%)

### ✅ Google Sheets Compatible
- Zero merged cells
- All formulas work in both Excel and Google Sheets
- Can upload directly without conversion issues
