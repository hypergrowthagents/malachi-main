## Key Operating Assumptions

### Capacity & Hiring Model

**Founder Capacity Constraint:**
- Solo: 3-4 total clients max
- With 1 offshore PM: 2 consulting + 4-5 managed clients
- With PM + Senior AM: 0-1 consulting + 8-10 managed clients

**Tiered Hiring Costs:**
- 0-1 clients: $0 (founder solo)
- 2-5 clients: $3,000/month (1 offshore PM via Deel)
- 6+ clients: $8,000/month ($3K PM + $5K Senior Account Manager)

**Rationale:** Each PM can handle 3-4 clients effectively. Senior AM manages 2-3 PMs at scale.

### Tax & Revenue Recognition

- **Tax Rate:** 40% (placeholder for combined federal/state/self-employment)
- **Net Multiplier:** 60% of gross revenue
- **Recognition:** Monthly recurring (assumes upfront payment)

### Operating Costs

**Monthly Recurring:**
- Payment processing: 2.9% of gross revenue
- Legal/accounting: $300/month
- Business insurance: $150/month
- DEEL/EOR fees: $50-100/month (per offshore employee)
- Software/API: 5% of gross revenue (Anthropic, hosting, CRM, analytics)
- Platform hosting: $1,500/month (when self-service launches)

**One-Time:**
- Platform development: $30,000 (M7-M9 in Realistic/Optimistic)
- Self-service CAC: $500/user

**Total Operating Overhead:** ~$1,000-$4,000/month (scenario and scale dependent)

## Client Acquisition Assumptions

### Conservative Scenario
- M1-M3: 1 consulting + 1 managed → 2 consulting + 2 managed
- M4-M12: Slow ramp to 2 consulting + 3 managed (holds consulting longer)
- Acquisition rate: 1 managed client every 2-3 months
- No self-service launch

### Realistic Scenario
- M1-M6: 2-3 consulting + 2-3 managed (foundation phase)
- M7-M9: Phase consulting to 1-2, ramp managed to 5 (transition phase)
- M10-M12: 0-1 consulting + 6 managed + 10 self-service (scaled phase)
- Acquisition rate: 1 managed client every 1.5 months
- Self-service launch M10

### Optimistic Scenario
- M1-M6: Rapid consulting → managed transition
- M7-M12: 0 consulting + 9 managed + 25 self-service
- Acquisition rate: 1-2 managed clients per month
- Self-service launch M8-M10

---

## Key Financial Milestones

**Break-Even Timing:**
- Conservative: M6-M7 (with consulting income bridge)
- Realistic: M4-M5 (faster managed service ramp)
- Optimistic: M3-M4 (aggressive growth)

**Cash Position Low Points:**
- Worst-Case: Bankrupt by M7 ($0 revenue scenario)
- Conservative: M1 dip to $98K (builds from there)
- Realistic: M9 dip to $132K (due to $30K platform dev), recovers immediately
- Optimistic: Steady climb throughout

**Runway Analysis:**
- Starting cash: $108K
- Monthly burn (no revenue): $16,285/month
- Worst-case runway: 6-6.5 months (bankrupt M7)
- Conservative cushion: 90+ months at M12 (effectively infinite)

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Land first 1-2 clients M1-M2** - Validates demand, starts cash flow
2. **Hire offshore PM by M3** - Unlocks capacity to scale beyond 3-4 clients
3. **Maintain consulting income through M7-M10** - Margin cushion during transition
4. **Delay self-service until M10** - Prevent distraction, invest when cash is strong
5. **Achieve 95%+ client retention** - Model assumes minimal churn

---

## Risk Factors

**Revenue Risks:**
- Slower client acquisition than projected (6.5mo runway if zero clients)
- Higher churn than 0% assumed (10% monthly churn would reduce M12 cash by ~$30K)
- Lower media spend per client than $50-85K range

**Cost Risks:**
- Platform development >$30K (mitigated by phased approach)
- Offshore hiring at higher rates ($4-5K vs $3K budgeted)
- Software/API costs exceeding 5% of revenue (Claude API usage spike)

**Execution Risks:**
- Founder capacity constraint limits growth if PM hire delayed
- Self-service product-market fit unproven (Year 1 launch is optional)
- Competition from traditional agencies at lower pricing

---

## Recommendations

**Primary Plan:** Execute Realistic scenario with Conservative as downside protection
- Focus Year 1 on consulting bridge + managed service scaling
- Delay self-service to M10+ (optional, only if cash >$130K)
- Monitor monthly vs. scenario projections; pivot to Conservative if trailing by 20%+

**Next Review:** After M1 actuals (projected November 2025)
