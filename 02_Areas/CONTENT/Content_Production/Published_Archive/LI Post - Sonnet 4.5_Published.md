spent 4 hours today with the new sonnet 4.5 model and it's been incredible  
  
context management that actually works been building in claude code all day. the model literally edits its own memory mid-conversation - keeps relevant context, cuts the noise. been hovering between 25-45% context usage for hours and haven't had to clear the chat once.  
  
brainstorming that pushes back asked it to play cofounder and challenge my assumptions about a growth strategy. it didn't just agree and expand my ideas like every other model. it found holes in my logic i couldn't see and asked questions that made me rethink the whole approach.  
  
anthropic's been cooking with this one! i was honestly shocked at how it distilled complex problems and highlighted blind spots i had completely missed.  
  
anyone else notice their ai conversations getting more... "direct" today?
