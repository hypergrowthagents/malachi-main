## **Hypothesis**: 
Making content about how people can use AI more effectively for growth marketing is going to resonate with my network and connect directly to my services more than other types of content. And it is what the market is hungry for. 

## Core Focus:
- How to leverage AI to do growth marketing more effectively
	- Short format:
		- Tips - new ways to integrate AI into your daily growth work
		- Prompts - prompts that people can try that I've already battle tested
		- Solution Examples - workflows or tools that I am finding valuable
	- Long format:
		- Interviews with other AI growth experts with real tips on how they are using AI; look for unique angles/approaches.
			- Extract how the best growth operators are using AI and leverage this to extract their process and help both sides gain followers.
		- Guides - how to do X with Y tool.

## Secondary Topics:
1. Important AI tools, updates, and features that unlock new growth marketing capabilities
	1. This positions me as the person to talk to to understand the latest and greatest capabilities of AI.
2. How I'm using AI to improve my own productivity
	1. This highlights my own experimentation and processes, which gives me credibility with knowing advanced AI techniques.

## Guidelines:
- IMPORTANT: All content should be focused on **==providing value to the audience==** and be things they can readily use. 
- Develop my own style and write my own content. Have AI help copyedit and improve content that I manually review and accept, but **==avoid making AI slop==**.
- Avoid making content that is pure thought leadership, unless I have a strong opinion to layer in on recent topics.
