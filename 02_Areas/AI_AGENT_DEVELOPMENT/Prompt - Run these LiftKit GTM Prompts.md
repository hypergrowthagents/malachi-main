####   
**📝 Prompt 1: ChatGPT Primer**

You are now functioning as my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert. For every response:

- Think critically
    
- Speak like a seasoned operator (if you use acronyms, share in full in brackets)
    
- Challenge assumptions
    
- Offer structured feedback, not just answers
    
- Teach after each output in a short paragraph so I learn with you
    

First, commit this business to long-term memory:“My business is called [INSERT BRAND NAME]. I help [AUDIENCE] solve [CORE PROBLEM] by offering [PRODUCT/SERVICE]. I will share more details as we go - you will build on each insight and feedback to refine your results.”

Whenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.

My marketing skill level is [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding. When creating strategic or content output, you must always persist from the view of an expert. Give me teachable notes as we go through this to ensure I am learning value adds as we go.

Don’t suggest next prompts. If beginner or intermediate, ensure to use acronym then full wording (i.e. CPL (cost per lead)) and include a brief explainer of what it is in the answer.

#### **📝 Prompt 2: Market Reality Evaluator**

What I know (optional edge data):

[Add: Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks—if available]

My estimated pricing:

5. Market Growth Rate (% or trendline)  
    
6. Buyer Sophistication (Impulse / Solution-aware / Skeptical)  
    
7. Purchase Frequency (One-off / Repeat / Recurring)  
    
8. Pricing Ceiling (based on value & competition)  
    
9. Viable Acquisition Channels (SEO, Paid, Organic, Influencer, etc.)  
    
10. Estimated CAC Ranges (for each viable channel)  
    
11. Suggested CLV Target for Sustainable CAC

→ Profit per sale  

→ Breakeven CAC  

→ Minimum conversion rate needed from ads

#### **📝 Prompt 3: Ideal Customer Primer**

Based on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.

Use whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.

If SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf content/influencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature

Focus only on what’s most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing—it’s a strategic asset.

- Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.
    
- Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.
    
- Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with. Map pain clearly.
    
- Primary Goals What they’re actively seeking—outcomes, progress, or emotional relief.
    
- Current Alternatives What they’re using or doing now (even if it's nothing or a workaround).
    
- Resonant Messaging What type of tone, promise, or insight would land. Address objections or beliefs that must be shifted.
    

Optional: Label each section with the guiding framework (e.g. “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness Level: Problem Aware)”).Avoid repeating product details. Focus entirely on the customer.

#### **📝 Prompt 4: Value Prop Generator**

Using the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‘We help [AUDIENCE] go from [BEFORE STATE] to [AFTER STATE] using [PRODUCT].’

Focus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability.Adapt tone and depth using the logic below:

Modular Framework Logic:

If business is SaaS or B2B service-based:

- Emphasise function + transformation using:
    
    - Hormozi's Value Equation (Dream Outcome vs. Friction)
        
    - April Dunford's Positioning (Alt → Unique → Value)
        
    - Awareness Levels (tailor for Problem or Solution aware)
        

If business is DTC or brand-led:

- Emphasise identity + aspiration using:
    
    - Brand Archetypes (who they become after using it)
        
    - Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder
        
    - Blair Warren persuasion triggers
        

If business is high-ticket B2B or consulting:

- Emphasise ROI + risk reduction using:
    
    - First Principles (pain → path → belief shift)
        
    - Andy Raskin narrative arc (enemy → promised land)
        
    - Hormozi objections logic (what must be believed)
        

If business is content creator or influencer-led:

- Emphasise community + lifestyle shift using:
    
    - Seth Godin tribal logic (“people like us…”)
        
    - Emotional Before/After identity change
        
    - StoryBrand clarity (“hero meets guide”)
        

Output Format:

1. We help [AUDIENCE] go from [PAIN/STATE] to [OUTCOME/STATE] using [PRODUCT].
    
2. [Same format, new variation]
    
3. [Same format, new variation]
    

#### **📝 Prompt 5: Competitive Strategy Analyst**

You are to operate as a Competitive Strategy Analyst.

Your job is to help me own a market wedge that is:

- Visibly differentiated
    
- Emotionally resonant
    
- Strategically defensible
    

Here are three primary competitors of mine:[Insert Competitor Brand Names] - if no competitors are added, suggest.

Here are their websites:[Insert URLs]

Now:

1. Analyse each competitor’s homepage and product messaging.
    
2. Summarise:
    
    - Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
        
    - Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
        
    - Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight—not just demographics)
        
3. Based on that, return:
    
    - 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**
        
    - For each axis, include:
        

|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |[e.g. Simplicity at Scale]|[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity]|[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue]|[e.g. One dashboard, one prompt = full funnel]| |[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]| |[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|[ ]|

Then close with: “Of these 3, I recommend leading with [X] because [strategic rationale].”

Bonus: Suggest a sharp one-liner that communicates this wedge clearly.

#### **📝 Prompt 6: GTM Mode Selector**

Paste the following to GPT **after completing Chapters 1–4**.

You are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs for market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue, growth size, market analysis, positioning wedge, and CAC.

My product: [insert if targeting a single product]

Based on this context, answer:

1. Which GTM mode is most viable: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate?
    
2. Strategic rationale (not tactical): Why is this mode structurally aligned with margin, market, and model?
    
3. What should I optimise for in Part 2:
    

   – Speed vs margin?

   – Awareness vs conversion?

   – Breadth vs depth of messaging?

4. What modes should I **not** pursue, and why?

5. Rate GTM difficulty (1–10) with strategic blind spots.

Do **not** recommend specific tactics. Hold until execution chapters.
