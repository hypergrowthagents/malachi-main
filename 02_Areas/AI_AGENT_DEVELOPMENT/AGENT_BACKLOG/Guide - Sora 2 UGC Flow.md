I recorded a 9-minute Loom video breaking down my entire process, including the prompts,Â [which you can find here](https://www.loom.com/share/d2d9a9b64594485ea41249563f165722?sid=e29e19b0-2d2f-4547-82cf-5974ddafeaae "https://www.loom.com/share/d2d9a9b64594485ea41249563f165722?sid=e29e19b0-2d2f-4547-82cf-5974ddafeaae").

## Video Process Breakdown

1. Found a video with 1600 likes on Instagram as the inspiration
2. Used Snapinsta.to product to download the video from the IG URL
3. Upload the video to Google Gemini and use 2.5 Pro if available. Ask it to provide the scene-by-scene prompts for each scene that describes each element of the video and dialogue and makes it into a script so that it can be recreated in a new video tool. 
	1. Either make it a 10 second video or break it into a couple of videos
4. Had to iterate on the prompt to get it to add voice/dialogue, which can probably be solved with better prompting
5. Uploaded the two files into Capcut
6. Went to ElevenLabs > text to speech > grabbed dialogue of script from Google, picked a voice, then clicked "generate speech" using a UGC influencer voice he had used.
	1. Played with the text length until the output matched the video length
7. Uploaded 3 different audio options and trimmed it a bit in Capcut

## Callouts

- Sora has a 10 second limit currently (vs. 8 sec with Veo)
- You are not allowed to upload a reference image with a person in it. You can upload a product without a person to put it into the video... no character consistency
