This AI system creates UGC videos with consistent characters & product shots at scale.

And auto-stitches everything together into finished content.

Perfect for e-comm operators & creative agencies who need brand consistency.

Just upload ONE product image and get complete UGC campaigns with the same character across all videos.

Here's how it works:

→ Upload product image via n8n form

→ AI analyzes your product automatically

→ Nano Banana generates consistent character variations

→ Veo 3 creates multiple video scenes with same talent

→ Auto-combines all clips into final campaign video

→ Ready-to-download UGC content in minutes

Built 100% in n8n.

Fully automated character consistency.
