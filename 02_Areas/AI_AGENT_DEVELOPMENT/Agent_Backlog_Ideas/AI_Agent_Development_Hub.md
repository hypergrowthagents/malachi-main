## 🔄 Agent Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Rapid Idea Capture
**Goal**: Maximum concepts on the board with minimal investment

1. **Brainstorming Session**
   - Activate Agent-Idea-Developer in Rapid Ideation Mode
   - Generate 15-20 concepts in 30-45 minutes
   - Quick categorization (Content, Business, Analytics, Productivity)
   - Immediate registry addition with basic effort/value estimates

2. **Registry Management**
   - Add concepts to [[Master_Agent_Registry]] table
   - Status starts at 💡 Concept
   - Link to placeholder specification pages
   - Weekly cleanup and refinement

### Phase 2: Strategic Selection
**Goal**: Choose concepts worth specification development

3. **Portfolio Analysis**
   - Use `/agent-development-lab` for strategic review
   - Evaluate business alignment and technical feasibility
   - Prioritize based on learning value, business impact, demonstration value
   - Select 2-3 concepts for detailed specification

4. **MVP Specification Development**
   - Activate Agent-Idea-Developer in MVP Specification Mode
   - Create detailed specs with explicit scope constraints
   - Define success criteria and validation approaches
   - Time-box development estimates with hard limits

### Phase 3: Development Pipeline
**Goal**: Systematic progression from concept to production

5. **Status Progression**
   - 💡 Concept → 🔍 Research → 🛠️ Ready → 🚀 Active → 🏭 Production
   - Move 🚀 Active agents to `01_Projects/[Agent_Name]/`
   - Track development metrics and velocity
   - Regular go/no-go decision points

6. **Production Integration**
   - Deploy completed agents to `.claude/agents/`
   - Document lessons learned and reusable patterns
   - Evaluate commercialization and client application potential
   - Create content opportunities for technical leadership demonstration
