## Blurb:
"I bridge performance marketing at massive scale with AI-native systems building:  
• Scale proven: Directly responsible for $50M+ annual budgets at Zynga, 55%+ ROAS increase, #1 app launches  
• AI company expertise: Built paid engines for ElevenLabs and Fireflies (zero → $1M+/mo profitable spend)  
• Technical depth: Build AI growth systems (ad prediction engines, ML-powered pLTV models, automated workflows), not just run campaigns. Partner fluently with engineering/data science teams.  
  
Your team gets someone who's scaled ChatGPT-comparable products to millions of users and builds the AI-first infrastructure this role requires. I would be thrilled to get to apply my craft for one of my favorite companies that I get to use daily - OpenAI."
