## Categories:
  1. AI Productivity Systems: Techniques and solutions that allow individuals and teams to move faster using AI.
  - Agent Idea 1: Personal OS. Turn this project/vault into a repeatable system that I can implement for other professionals to enable them to use Claude Code as their personal
  assistant. It will utilize PARA method + Claude Code + Obsidian + Github. And leverage this setup as a content piece as well, offering the outline for free and the
  implementation for a small cost. I think a lot of people would be interested in something like this.
  - Agent Idea 2: Team OS. Implement the Claude Master Prompt for teams (give them instructions and have an agent that can act as a wizard to help them). Implement the PARA method
  of organization. Enable Claude Master Prompt to sync with the internal organization system to be able to pull in regular updates from things like meeting notes, project docs,
  etc.

  2. Ad Creative: Solve the pain point of having high performing, on brand ad creative that performance teams can use to test and iterate.**Dynamic creative generation system that
  produces high-performing marketing assets autonomously. Note: I also have Higgsfield AI subscription with access to Google's Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image mode), Veo 3,
  and unlimited Kling 2.1 for video generation, plus I have a separate subscripton to Descript for editing or can try Capcut. So I have the necessary ingredients to test out a lot
  of create AI, then later can build them into agents once I have the process humming.
  - Agent Idea 1: Build an AI UGC Video creation process using the process essentially that is outlined in @03_Resources/Agents/AI_UGC_Video_Ads.md , leveraging Google Nano
  Banana, ChatGPT/Claude, and Veo3. Potentially all in Higgsfield. I'd do it manually before attempting automation.
  - Agent Idea 2: Automate creative testing plans, leveraging learning objectives added by the user, ICP research, and best practices for what drives the highest impact. Split
  testing plans into different lanes for net new concept development vs. modular creative testing. Overlaps with performance marketing agent ideas.
  - Agent Idea 3: Automate creative briefs. Brainstorm and synthesize a large number of concepts driven by ICP research and competitive research, and turn those into creative
  brief ideas to proritize, add to backlog, or kill (but track for record keeping).
  - Agent Idea 4: Ad copy generator. Expert copywriter than can automate writing new copy personalized to each ad (image or keyword) and platform.
  - Agent Idea 5: Static Image variant creator. Leverage Nano banana to turn on image into 100s to allow for rapid testing across modular variables. Extract winners and use them
  for video generation.
  - Agent Idea 6: Competitive ads researcher. Likely connected to the concept creative briefs. Scrape Meta/YouTube/TikTok/LinkedIn to determine which ads are working. Analyze the
  videos using Google's omni model functionality. Extract what is working and what the structure/template of that ad is. Use it as a means of both educating creative teams and
  informing creative briefs. Research would be based on things like length ad has been running, number of similar variants.
  - Agent Idea 7: Video script writer. Come up with high conversion video scripts tailored to each platform.
  - Agent Idea 8: Video hook writer. Come up with hook variants designed to improve video completion. Standalone from #7.
  - Agent Idea 9: Carousel generator for Meta and LinkedIn. Uses pain point analysis to map out a 5 slide narrative on the problem and solution.
  - Agent Idea 10: Creative testing analyzer. Crosses over with data and performance agent categories. This agent would monitor creative testing campaigns and let you know once a
  breakout or stat sig winner has been achieved, to flow back into the other agents in this system.
  - Agent Idea 11: ICP deep research. Run deep research using generally available data from social networks and trust signals online to identify the use cases, pain points and
  motivators (e.g. g2, trustpilot). Use this as an input into the other creative agents to ensure the outputs are dialed in to the needs of the customer. Can also upload existing
  ICP research to augment or replace this step.
  - Agent Idea 12: Brand style guide (deep research). Extract the brand colors, style, and tone from available resources (e.g. internal style guide, website, owned social
  channels) to further hone in creative.
  - Agent Idea 13: Customer focus group agent. Runs any creative concept through a synthetic focus group to provide feedback, refinements, and new ideas.
  - Agent Idea 14: Ad Prediction engine. Tests ad creative using synthetic customer research panel and analyst to determine which ad will perform based on a variety of factors.
  Goal is to remove low performing ideas and focus on testing high potential concepts (vs. trying to accurately predict winners). Future development idea for this agent would be
  to connect it with the creative testing analyzer agent to have a closed feedback loop of recursive learning and improvement.
  - Agent Idea 15: Copywriter agent. General purpose copywriter agent that is capable of creative first drafts or providing feedback/polish to existing assets and can be used
  across almost any creative type.

  3. Analytics and Insights: Transform complex business data into actionable intelligence that can be used to take action across performance marketing campaigns.
  - Agent Idea 1: Daily ad ops diagnostic. Daily report sent to Slack to let team know of anything that needs immediate attention, focusing in on the main issues to promote rapid
  action. Works across Meta/Google.
  - Agent Idea 2: Weekly performance report. Weekly report (or multiple times per week) diagnosing the major KPI movements and what is causing them with ideas for optimization.
  Works across Meta/Google.
  - Agent Idea 3: Ad hoc analysis (ad network data). Agent that connects with your ad networks directly and you can ask it any question to enable it to go off and identify trends,
  insights, and action items. Uses Gomarble MCP or we rebuild it with our own tech (longer term).
  - Agent Idea 4: Bid and budget optimizer. Campaign ROAS Analysis. Develop bid optimization and budget reallocation recommendations within a channel (and a related agent that
  does it across channels) to improve overall ROAS.
  - Agent Idea 5: Ad hoc analysis (database data). Agent that connects with your source of truth database and that you can use to ask questions about your data.
  - Agent Idea 6: Funnel analysis agent. Builds and analyzes a user funnel and determines where the biggest problem is and which levers exist or might make sense to dig into to
  solve that funnel gap.
  - Agent Idea 7: LTV analysis. Can take uploaded CSVs or mapped database tables that have cohorted revenue and build out LTV curves by date and data dimension (geo, product,
  channel). Future version includes Predictive LTV agent, which fits LTV curves using different LTV methodologies, identifies the best fit model (e.g. power curve, logarithmic,
  etc.) and builds out robust pLTV views and formulas that can be used for ongoing pLTV tracking.
  - Agent Idea 8: User intent signals. Option A -  Scans the website and onboarding to identify every potential signal that might be useful for conversion tracking as part of the
  user funnel. Option B - Scans the database or ad networks to do the same type of mapping of conversion events. Processes it through a proprietary framework to assess which
  events are likely the best fit for optimization. Option C: Runs complex regression of all signals available to identify what signals (or combo of signals) is most correlated
  with LTV and which has a high enough frequency to utilize for campaigns.
  - Agent Idea 9: Profit maximization model. Runs different scenarios and identifies what the optimal spend level is in order to generate the greatest amount of profit based on
  various payback windows.
  - Agent Idea 10: Payback model simulator. Calculates current payback period. Runs scenarios based on historical data to identify the elasticity of CAC based on spend levels and
  helps determine what payback looks like at various CAC levels.
  - Agent Idea 11: Monthly Insights Review. Pull budget and KPIs vs. target, splits by dimensions, trends, tests, learnings, and progression vs. testing roadmap (if one exists).

  4. Campaign Optimization: Reduces or eliminates the effort involved in managing paid acquisition campaigns.
  - Agent Idea 1: Bid adjuster. Slows reduces or increases bids according to ROAS and payback targets provided by the user in order to improve campaign efficiency while balancing for scale. Closely monitors incrementality of results.
  - Agent Idea 2: Budget adjuster. Slows reduces or increases budgets according to ROAS and payback targets provided by the user.
  - Agent Idea 3: New audience tester. Evaluates new audiences to test based on ICP research, current audiences in use, and potential adjacent audiences that are ranked by priority and fit.
  - Agent Idea 4: Ad underperformance analyzer. Looks for ads that are above spend targets and not meeting minimum baselines for potential based on proxy signals. Proposes cuts to user to approve.
  - Agent Idea 5: Campaign and ad set analyzer. Looks for campaigns/ad sets that are not meeting minimum KPIs and have enough data to evaluate. Recommends actions to user to approve.

  5. Growth Strategy: Specialized agents that are capable or orchestrating other workflows or performing research and analysis projects. Capable of running deep audits and competitive research and recommending plans for the team to execute.
- Agent Idea 1: Functional audit. User uploads existing channel reports (or leverages connected database/ad networks), fill in questionnaire, set goals/targets. Agent kicks off many parallel deep analysis tasks, synthesizes them together, with main issues, areas of opportunity and 90 day plan.
	- Replicate this agent across: B2C Paid acquisition audit, B2B paid acquisition audit, Ad creative testing, Landing pages/CRO, User funnel audit, data infrastructure audit.
	- Might be a good idea to onboard partner solutions that are specialized at specific parts of this (like onboarding analysis) and then use my subagents to synthesize and present as actionable.
- Agent Idea 2: Quarterly Business Review. Automated insights generation as a presentation across all of the performance marketing program, including learnings, wins, challenges, opportunities, etc. Synthesis of all other inputs and produces a roadmap the team can approve (and agents can use to inform learning and execution priorities).
- Agent Idea 3: GTM strategy agent. Analyzes historical patterns used successfully by other competitors/adjacent companies. Looks for opportunities to clone what worked. Identifies points of differentiation and ways to lean into those strength in novel ways. Builds a structured plan and milestones. Analyzes and ranks opportunities and tactics by risk and impact. Has multiple human-in-the-loop points to collect feedback and iterate on the output until it feels honed. Basically a business plan and distribution strategy that is augmented with a lot of critical info.

6. Other
- Agent Idea 1: Conversion Tracking Implementer. Uses something like Claude Code SDK to run the end-to-end implementation of conversion event setup in Google Tag Manager to ad networks. 

  Note: a bunch of these overlap or could be daisy chained together in interesting ways, so we'd want to design this into modular and flexible agent components that could be built
  upon. I'd envision most of these being built in n8n and many of them leveraging user input with forms to fill in critical context.
