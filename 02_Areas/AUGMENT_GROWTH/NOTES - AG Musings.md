- LEVERAGE: I need to find a path to making Augment a nearly 100% software solution at some point in order to scale, otherwise I’ll always be limited by my own time. I need to achieve a 70%+ margin.
- I can take on several consulting gigs in the meantime to pay the bills and buy myself time to figure out the platform. That helps solve the cash flow gap.
- I need to find a market that is worth over $1bn according to Michia Rohrssen, or $2bn if raising venture. So I need to find a big enough market with a high severity pain point that is currently underserved.

Potential Markets:
- Media agencies that are dying or being squeezed (but they’ll want to build it themselves perhaps)
- Fully automated customer acquisition ***

# 10/10 Positioning

Simple HERO positioning:
- "We'll solve the main issues limiting your growth"

- In the HOW section, we can talk about how we'll deliver on that with AI agents and the outcomes.
- I could envision starting with a $5k assessment fee, then moving into a 90 day contract where I systematically solve each of their needs with pricing for each modular active workflow in a month or something like that.
