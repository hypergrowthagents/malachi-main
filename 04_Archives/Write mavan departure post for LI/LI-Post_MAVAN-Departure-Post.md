After 4.5 years at MAVAN, I'm stepping back from my leadership role to pursue my next chapter.

When I started here, I had serious imposter syndrome coming from mobile gaming/fintech. Thought my expertise wouldn't translate outside those verticals.

Turns out I was completely wrong. Working with dozens of startups across AI, fintech, ecom, B2B, crypto, and more taught me that while tactics evolve constantly, the fundamentals of growth hold up everywhere. That's been a very valuable lesson.

Huge thanks to @Matt, @Ellyn, @Jan for years of incredible collaboration and friendship. I'm genuinely excited about MAVAN's trajectory and will continue supporting where I can.

As for what's next, I'm diving into building something at the intersection of growth + AI. In the meantime, I may have room for one additional advisory role if anyone needs growth strategy help.

More to share soon.
