### Team Leadership

- Previous team structure at Branch (2+ years ago): growth team, analytics team, growth product team, brand team (creative, social media, PR)
  - Team sizes: ~25 marketing, ~100 sales, ~100 service
  - All teams have since shrunk due to challenging insurance market conditions
    - Climate change + inflation made claims more expensive than predicted
    - VC-funded tech companies struggled more than established carriers with large surplus
- Management philosophy: very slow to hire
  - Prefers to understand problems deeply before adding headcount
  - Does work himself first to understand requirements before delegating
  - Self-described as “guy who could do it all, but none of it the best”
- Accountability initiative: implemented monthly “marketing lookback” white papers
  - Documented results and learnings across all org areas
  - Team initially uncomfortable with increased accountability and reflection
  - Process revealed performance gaps and accelerated optimization
  - Example: vastly improved performance marketing cycle for $1M/month spend
    - Achieved lower cost per policy
    - Improved PLE (policy lifetime expectancy) retention metric

### Brand Strategy

- FanDuel rebrand experience (2014-2015):
  - Initial challenge: brand looked like “H&H vitamin brand on midnight local TV”
    - Testimonial-style ads: “Meet Frank, made $750,000 playing FanDuel”
    - Millions of promo codes tracking performance by daypart/channel
  - First rebrand attempt got “slapped down in 25th hour” due to executive fear
  - Crisis opportunity: NY Times investigation of competitor revealed industry cheating
    - FanDuel ads under fire, mocked on John Oliver
    - Brand metrics showed toxicity levels comparable to utility companies
- Successful rebrand strategy:
  - Root cause analysis: lack of trust from “faceless opponents taking money”
  - Target shift: from poker migrants to 20-30M season-long fantasy players
  - Solution: launched “Friends Mode” feature alongside rebrand
  - New attribution methods for TV campaigns vs. promo code tracking
- Measurement approach:
  - Friends Mode penetration rates
  - Season-long cohort penetration
  - Overall acquisition performance over longer time horizon

### CRM and Lifecycle

- Current Branch setup: operates 3 different CRM systems
  - Homegrown CRM with Iterable frontend for policyholders
    - Data warehouse integration for campaign building
  - HubSpot for independent agent network
    - Added behavioral data tracking for agents
    - Metrics: offers attempted per 90 days, triggers for low-activity agents
  - EasyLinks (new): insurance agency-specific CRM for selling other carriers
  - MR note: it’s a little concerning to me that he’s booting up 3 CRMs to run in parallel as that is a lot of complexity without it being super clear what the payoff is.
- Retention optimization results: 10% improvement over 4-5 months
  - Strategy: “less is more” hypothesis for renewal communications
  - Process: incremental A/B testing removing communications
  - Key insight: added educational context about premium adjustments
    - Explained auto-adjustments for increased coverage needs
    - Higher retention when customers understood value of changes
- Testing methodology:
  - Control 50% receiving standard communications
  - Strip away individual elements and measure 30-day cohort performance
  - Roll out improvements at statistical significance
  - Add back educational components to optimize retention

### General Feedback

- Communication style: casual and engaging conversationalist, very friendly
- Tendency to provide extensive background context rather than focusing on process details
- Most of his answers to his process or accomplishments were based on someone else on his team doing a major part of it. Open question: how well would he operate having to do these things independently in some questions.
