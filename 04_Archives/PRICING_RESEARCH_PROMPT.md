# PRICING RESEARCH SESSION PROMPT
**For Fresh Context Session - Comprehensive Pricing Strategy Development**

---

## Session Objective
Develop comprehensive pricing scenarios for Augment Growth Services that balance **industry competitive standards** with **Morpheus product evolution** from MVP to full platform, enabling accurate financial modeling across multiple business development phases.

## Background Context

### Target Market: Bridge Companies
- **Profile**: Late seed/Pre-Series A companies ($3-8M raised, $60K-100K monthly ad spend)
- **Market size**: Several thousand companies globally per quarter
- **Budget capacity**: 10-20% of revenue allocated to marketing
- **Competitive landscape**: Established agencies charging $15K-100K+ monthly

### Current Pricing Baseline
**Market research findings**: Industry standard 10-20% of ad spend, suggesting $10K-15K monthly is competitive and sustainable (vs. initial $7.5K assumption).

### Morpheus Product Vision
AI-powered growth marketing platform that will evolve from basic automation to sophisticated multi-agent marketing operations system. Need pricing that works at different capability levels.

## Research & Analysis Required

### 1. Competitive Pricing Deep Dive
**Objective**: Map detailed pricing structures across competitive landscape

**Research Areas:**
- **Performance marketing agencies** serving $60K-100K ad spend clients
- **AI-enhanced marketing services** and premium positioning strategies
- **SaaS + Services hybrid models** (recurring revenue + usage-based components)
- **Tiered pricing structures** and capability-based pricing differences
- **Geographic pricing variations** (US, Europe, other markets)

**Key Questions:**
- How do top agencies price percentage vs. retainer vs. hybrid models?
- What services justify premium pricing tiers ($15K+ vs. $10K vs. lower)?
- How do agencies handle pricing as client ad spend scales up/down?
- What pricing models work best for recurring revenue predictability?

### 2. Morpheus Evolution Pricing Framework
**Objective**: Create pricing that scales with product capability development

**Product Development Phases to Consider:**
- **Phase 1 (0-6 months)**: Basic AI automation, manual oversight, foundational capabilities
- **Phase 2 (6-12 months)**: Enhanced automation, improved targeting, creative optimization
- **Phase 3 (12-18 months)**: Multi-agent coordination, advanced analytics, strategic insights
- **Phase 4 (18+ months)**: Full platform sophistication, minimal human intervention needed

**Pricing Strategy Considerations:**
- **Value-based progression**: How does pricing increase with capability enhancement?
- **Client retention**: How to avoid pricing clients out as platform improves?
- **Market positioning**: How to communicate value increases effectively?
- **Competitive moats**: What pricing creates defensibility at each phase?

### 3. Financial Model Scenarios
**Objective**: Create 3-5 distinct pricing scenarios for financial modeling

**Scenario Framework:**
Each scenario should include:
- **Monthly recurring revenue structure**
- **Client acquisition assumptions**
- **Revenue per client at different ad spend levels**
- **Pricing elasticity and client retention implications**
- **Scalability and margin characteristics**
- **Competitive positioning strength/weakness**

**Suggested Scenarios to Explore:**
1. **Conservative Industry Standard**: 10-15% ad spend + management fee
2. **Premium AI-First**: Higher base pricing justified by AI sophistication
3. **Hybrid Performance**: Base retainer + performance bonuses tied to growth metrics
4. **Tiered Capability**: Different pricing for different service sophistication levels
5. **Usage-Based Scaling**: Pricing that scales with client growth and platform usage

### 4. Market Positioning Analysis
**Objective**: Determine optimal competitive positioning for each pricing scenario

**Analysis Areas:**
- **Value proposition alignment**: What story does each pricing level tell?
- **Client acquisition fit**: Which scenarios make sales easier/harder?
- **Market perception**: How does pricing affect brand perception in market?
- **Scalability implications**: Which models best support business growth?
