look up whether using my master prompt as Claude.md will improve my vault outputs in the same way as personalizing Claude instructions does


## Claude Code's Response to the idea:

## Final Recommendation: Don't Port the Full Master Prompt

After deep analysis, here's the strategic answer:

### The Core Issue

**Claude.ai vs Claude Code have fundamentally different economics:**

- **Claude.ai**: Personal preferences are system context (doesn't count against your tokens)
- **Claude Code**: CLAUDE.md counts against every message in every session

Your current 7,200-character CLAUDE.md (~2,400 tokens) costs **60,000+ tokens in a 30-message session** due to compounding. That's your entire Pro tier window.

### The Key Insight

**Only 35% of your current CLAUDE.md content is needed for most sessions.** The other 65% is valuable but situational:

- **Always needed**: PARA structure, tagging basics, energy patterns
- **Sometimes needed**: Strategic mode, agent definitions, career context
- **Rarely needed**: Advanced tagging details, specific agent documentation

Current approach loads 100% of context even when you're just organizing files or fixing simple bugs.

### Recommended Architecture: "Slim Core + Rich References"

**Token savings: 41% (~2M tokens/month) while preserving 90% of personalization**

```
/CLAUDE.md (1,400 tokens - always loaded)
  ├─ Core organizational rules (PARA, 3-level max depth)
  ├─ Basic tagging and wiki-links
  ├─ Energy patterns (for scheduling)
  ├─ Current year context (2025)
  └─ Meta-instruction: "Load contexts on-demand"

/.claude/contexts/ (load when needed)
  ├─ strategic-mode.md (co-founder mindset, business context)
  ├─ agents-library.md (all 10+ agent definitions)
  └─ career-context.md (resume targeting, LinkedIn strategy)

/.claude/commands/
  ├─ /strategic (loads business context)
  ├─ /agents (loads agent library)
  └─ /career (loads resume/LinkedIn context)
```

### What Goes in Core vs Context Library

**Core (1,400 tokens - high frequency):**

- File organization rules (you use this daily)
- Energy patterns (needed for time blocking)
- PARA structure (used constantly)
- Basic workflow instructions

**Context Library (load on-demand):**

- Strategic business context (only needed for strategy work)
- Agent definitions (reference material, not instructions)
- Career targeting details (only for resume/LinkedIn tasks)

### Implementation Path

**Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1)**

- Keep current setup, track which sections you actually reference
- Note when full context was overkill vs helpful

**Phase 2: Split (Week 2)**

- Create slim core based on usage data
- Move situational content to context library
- Set up slash commands for quick loading

**Phase 3: Optimize (Ongoing)**

- Core gradually absorbs frequently-needed patterns
- Prune rarely-used content from context files

### Role Separation Strategy

**Use each tool for its strengths:**

 

**Claude.ai** (with full "master prompt"):

- Strategic business thinking
- Content creation and ideation
- Career planning discussions
- Long brainstorming sessions

**Claude Code** (with slim instructions):

- Project management and file organization
- Technical implementation
- Daily planning execution
- Task-specific work

This prevents you from paying token costs for personality context when you're just organizing files.

### Concrete Next Step

Would you like me to:

1. **Create the optimized file structure** (split your current CLAUDE.md into core + contexts)
2. **Set up the slash commands** for quick context loading
3. **Track usage for a week first** to validate assumptions with real data

Which approach feels right for your workflow?
