## About Section
**Copy to use:**
```
I'm a mobile growth veteran turned AI-augmented growth executive. After managing nine-figure annual advertising budgets and helping scale companies from startups to profitable exits, I now deploy AI solutions to make growth teams more efficient.

Over the past decade, I've led growth at some of the world's preeminent mobile gaming and fintech companies - from helping Zynga achieve a profitable turnaround as Director of Growth Marketing to doubling ARR at Digit before their $212M exit. More recently, I built and scaled MAVAN growth agency from inception as employee #1, serving as fractional CMO/CGO for 50+ Series A-C companies.

Now I'm pioneering the intersection of traditional growth expertise and AI automation:

AI + Growth Tools I Use:
• LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) for strategy and competitive analysis
• Automation platforms (n8n, Lindy.ai) for workflow optimization
• Agentic coding (Claude Code, Cursor, Warp) for custom solutions
• Research AI (Perplexity, Notebook LM) for market intelligence
• Built 40+ automations reducing operational time by 60-90%

Core Specialties:
• Growth Strategy & Performance Marketing
• Mobile User Acquisition (Facebook, Google, TikTok)
• AI-Powered Creative Testing & Analytics
• A/B Testing & Campaign Optimization  
• Fractional Executive Leadership
• GTM and Series A-C Startup Scaling

I'm passionate about the evolution of growth marketing - from manual processes to AI-augmented operations that deliver better results faster.

How may I help you?
