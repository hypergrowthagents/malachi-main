Selling agents is going to be tough. I think the ideal path is to first spend time designing a system of how interconnected agents benefit each other. Map them out. And determine if there are existing solutions that do it (that I don’t have to build).

Then rather than building one off agents, I can start to build the foundations and ultimately the whole pyramid of agents that form the system.

Example: a creative stack that goes from insight to concept to production to test

Service would include developing (in a standardized way of things I’d already built), implementing, customizing, and training. Can even include external tech.
