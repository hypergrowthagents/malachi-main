### Process:

1. List all of your current projects
	- Set a timer for 5 minutes and list anything that comes to mind when you hear the following questions:
		1. What's currently worrying you?
		2. What problem is taking you more mental bandwidth than it deserves?
		3. What needs to happen that you are not making consistent progress on?
		4. What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project that you've not yet identified?
		5. What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with?
		6. Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start?
		7. What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting?
2. Add a goal for each project
	- Add a goal for each project on the list
3. Add deadlines or timeframes
	- Add completion dates (doesn't matter whether it's a strict deadline or ideal target date)
4. Prioritize your list
	- Prioritize ONLY for the UPCOMING WEEK
	- Which of these projects should be taking up the bulk of your bandwidth?
	- Which of these projects should be taking little or none of the bandwidth for this week?
5. Reevaluate your project list
	1. Which goals or priorities you say are important to you don't have any projects associated with them? These are called dreams, since they aren't likely to happen in the near term.
	2. Which projects you are spending a lot of time on don't have any goals associated with them? These are called hobbies, because without a goal in mind they are likely just for fun.
	3. Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify?

### Tips/Reminders:

- Make this 5 step process part of a weekly review
- A project is any endeavor that has a goal and a deadline
- Your only goal in a given week is to make progress on a small handful of projects near the top of the list (usually recommends focusing on 2-3 rather than spreading yourself thin)
- Most people try to do too much - they need to say "no" and focus on the things that matter. Every time you say no to something less important, all that time and effort get freed up to do the things that are more important.

### Evaluation:

**Prioritize:**

- Consulting opportunities
- Getting feedback from my network on the AG service lines - are these solving real pain points? What is the real pain point they would be willing to spend money to solve relating to growth/ai?
- Determine which of the service line options has the most promise through network conversations

**Deprioritize:**

* Do not invest any additional amount of time to PARA/Obsidian structure for now; just get the basics in place to be able to accomplish these top 3 projects
* Rabbit holes on specific agent builds without a clear direction of what I am building and why
* Spending a lot of time on thought leadership pieces

**Re-evaluation of List:**

- I've been spending a TON of time learning about Claude Code recently without a clear goal connected to it, so this is currently more of an interest than a pure project or goal. 
	- Need to determine what role Claude Code is going to play and how I can progress towards achieving my goals by investing more time with it if I plan to spend dedicated time to learning and playing with it.
	- OR I can set aside ~60 mins a week to try out some new capability of Claude Code I'm curious about
- I can postpone housework, pickleball, Claude Code google ads projects, and AI UGC projects potentially. I can also postpone making a website for Augment Growth and just roll with a Gamma slide deck for now to keep it simple and fast to iterate on

## Week in Review - October 6-10, 2025

*Synthesized from daily planning docs by chief-of-staff agent on 2025-10-10*

### Major Accomplishments

**DMS Proposal Win (10/7):**
- ✅ **DMS proposal completed AND sent** to Jen Robinson same day (exceeded timeline)
- ✅ **Bonus deliverables**: Created reusable proposal template + proposal-builder subagent
- **Strategic excellence**: Prioritized concrete opportunity over exploratory work

**Business Development Momentum (10/10):**
- ✅ **Wyatt Ozmore call completed** - Owner.com collaboration opportunity identified
  - Timeline: Before December 1st
  - Approach: Starter project/experiment preferred
  - Next step: Follow up by 10/20
- ✅ **David Johnson feedback call** - AG pitch validation from trusted advisor

**Service Line Evolution:**
- ✅ Service_Offerings_v5 → v6 iteration based on network feedback
- ✅ Network validation conversations conducted (10/8-10/9 implied)
- 🎯 One-pager pitch development in progress (10/10 afternoon focus)

### What Worked Well

**Execution Speed When Scope is Clear:**
- DMS proposal: 2.5 hours from start to sent (9-11:30am block)
- Smart prioritization: Deferred AG pitch (10/7) to nail concrete opportunity first
- Template creation: Turned one-time work into reusable asset

**Customer-Led Development:**
- Network feedback actively shaping service model (v5 → v6)
- Weekly planning emphasis on validation being followed
- Multiple service line options mapped before committing

**Energy Alignment:**
- Morning high-energy blocks used for complex strategic work (DMS proposal)
- Meeting-heavy days aligned with natural energy patterns
- Low-energy periods used for admin, processing, and recovery

**Calendar-First Accountability:**
- Time blocks scheduled in advance created structure
- Follow-through on scheduled deep work sessions
- Calendar serves as source of truth for what gets accomplished

### Challenges & Obstacles

**Missing Daily Planning Documentation:**
- No daily planning docs for 10/8-10/9 (Tuesday-Wednesday)
- Gap makes it harder to track daily decision-making and time allocation
- Cannot assess whether this was intentional strategic work or planning lapse

**Deadline Slippage on AG Pitch:**
- **Planned**: First draft by 10/7, Gamma slides by 10/8
- **Actual**: Deferred to 10/10 for one-pager version
- **Reason**: Prioritized DMS concrete opportunity + service model iteration
- **Assessment**: Strategic decision, not execution failure, but still missed stated deadline

**Agent Prioritization Carried Forward:**
- **Original deadline**: 10/8 (5 agents to build)
- **Current status**: Deferred, no completion date identified
- **Pattern**: Lower priority than revenue-generating activities, but keeps slipping

**Network Outreach List:**
- **Deadline**: 10/10 (20 contacts)
- **Status**: Blocked on pitch completion
- **Insight**: Correct sequencing (can't outreach without pitch), but creates dependency chain

### Key Learnings

**Time Estimation Patterns:**

1. **Fast execution when scope is concrete:**
   - DMS proposal: 2.5 hours (matched estimate)
   - Evidence: Clear client conversation + defined pain points = rapid proposal

2. **Slow iteration when scope is emerging:**
   - AG pitch: 4+ days longer than planned (still in progress on 10/10)
   - Evidence: Service model evolving through network feedback = slower pitch development

3. **Strategic deferrals:**
   - Consciously pushed AG pitch (10/7) to focus on DMS
   - Bonus work on templates/agents created valuable assets without derailing priorities

**Energy & Focus Insights:**

1. **Meeting placement works well:**
   - 10:30am (Wyatt), 12-1pm (David) aligned with energy patterns
   - Morning meetings don't derail afternoon deep work blocks

2. **2-3 hour deep work blocks effective:**
   - 9-11:30am DMS proposal session = complete draft + sent
   - 2-5pm blocks scheduled but completion data unavailable (no 10/8-10/9 docs)

3. **Processing time needed between feedback and execution:**
   - Network feedback → Service v6 iteration → Pitch creation requires time
   - Can't compress customer validation into single-day cycles

**Strategic Decision-Making:**

1. **"Two types of consulting wins" insight validated:**
   - DMS: Clear scope → fast execution → sent in hours
   - AG: Unclear scope → slow iteration → taking weeks to nail
   - Knowing which type you're in changes planning approach

2. **Customer-led iteration beats assumption-led speed:**
   - Taking extra time for v5 → v6 based on feedback = better pitch quality
   - Network validation changing the business model in real-time (exactly what weekly planning prioritized)

3. **Concrete opportunities trump exploratory work:**
   - DMS proposal prioritization over AG pitch = correct call
   - Revenue-generating activities > internal process work (agent prioritization)

### Carry Forward to Next Week

**Must Complete (Overdue):**
1. **AG one-pager pitch** - In progress on 10/10, finish by 10/11
2. **Agent prioritization** - Due 10/8, carried forward from this week
3. **Network outreach list (20 contacts)** - Due 10/10, blocked on pitch completion

**High Priority:**
1. **Share AG pitch with first 5-10 network contacts** - Enable validation conversations
2. **Schedule 5+ validation calls** - Original deadline 10/15, achievable if pitch finishes 10/11
3. **Wyatt Ozmore follow-up** - Due by 10/20, next steps from 10/10 call
4. **DMS proposal follow-up** - Monitor Jen's response, be ready for next steps

**Medium Priority:**
1. **Create Gamma slides version of pitch** - After one-pager validated
2. **Expand network outreach list to 20** - After initial 5-10 contacted
3. **Content calendar planning** - Deprioritized per weekly eval, keep low

**Consider Dropping/Postponing:**
- LinkedIn content pillars (unless tied to AG pitch rollout)
- Content calendar planning (focus on business development first)
- Non-revenue agent builds (until service line validated)

### Pattern Insights for Daily_Planning_Insights.md

**Time Estimation:**
- Concrete scope tasks: Estimation accuracy high (DMS proposal = 2.5hrs as planned)
- Emerging scope tasks: Add 2-4 day buffer for iteration cycles (AG pitch = 4+ days vs 1-2 days planned)
- Customer validation work: Cannot compress into single days, needs breathing room

**Energy Alignment:**
- Morning high-energy (9-12pm) remains optimal for complex strategic work
- Meeting placement (10:30am, 12-1pm) doesn't disrupt productivity
- Afternoon high-energy (2-5pm) effective when not fatigued from morning meetings

**Obstacles:**
- Missing daily planning docs (10/8-10/9) create accountability gaps
- Dependency chains (pitch → outreach list) cause cascading delays
- Exploratory work expands to fill available time without forcing functions

**Process Improvements:**
- Bonus deliverables (templates, agents) create compounding value without derailing priorities
- Strategic deferrals (AG pitch for DMS) show good judgment
- Customer-led iteration (v5 → v6) prevents building wrong thing

**Productivity Patterns:**
- Week had 3 documented days vs 5 work days (60% daily planning coverage)
- Major wins despite gaps suggest execution is strong
- Need to determine if 10/8-10/9 were productive work days or planning lapse

### Questions for Accountability Review

1. **What happened on 10/8 and 10/9?**
   - Were these productive work days without documentation?
   - Or were these days off/low productivity?
   - Impact: Cannot assess full week effectiveness without this context

2. **AG pitch timeline - strategic deferral or execution issue?**
   - Original: First draft 10/7, Gamma slides 10/8
   - Actual: One-pager in progress 10/10
   - Was this conscious prioritization or scope creep?

3. **Agent prioritization - does this actually matter?**
   - Due 10/8, now TBD
   - Pattern: Keeps getting deprioritized for revenue work
   - Should this stay on the list or be officially postponed?

4. **Daily planning discipline:**
   - 3 of 5 work days documented (60%)
   - Is this the new pattern or an exception?
   - How does this affect accountability and learning?

### Week Success Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+ (Strong execution on priorities, incomplete documentation)**

**Wins:**
- ✅ DMS proposal: Exceeded expectations (sent same day + bonus deliverables)
- ✅ Business development: Wyatt opportunity identified
- ✅ Customer validation: Service model evolving based on feedback
- ✅ Strategic prioritization: Concrete opportunities over exploratory work

**Misses:**
- ⚠️ AG pitch: 3-4 days behind schedule (though strategic reasons)
- ⚠️ Agent prioritization: Missed 10/8 deadline
- ⚠️ Daily planning gaps: 10/8-10/9 undocumented
- ⚠️ Network outreach list: Due 10/10, blocked on pitch

**Net Assessment:**
Strong execution on revenue-generating activities with good strategic judgment, but documentation gaps and exploratory work timelines need improvement. The customer-led iteration approach is working (v5 → v6 based on feedback), but creates longer timelines than initially estimated.
