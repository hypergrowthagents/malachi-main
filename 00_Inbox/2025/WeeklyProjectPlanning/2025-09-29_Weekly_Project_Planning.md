### Process:

1. List all of your current projects
	- Set a timer for 5 minutes and list anything that comes to mind when you hear the following questions:
		1. What's currently worrying you?
		2. What problem is taking you more mental bandwidth than it deserves?
		3. What needs to happen that you are not making consistent progress on?
		4. What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project that you've not yet identified?
		5. What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with?
		6. Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start?
		7. What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting?
2. Add a goal for each project
	- Add a goal for each project on the list
3. Add deadlines or timeframes
	- Add completion dates (doesn't matter whether it's a strict deadline or ideal target date)
4. Prioritize your list
	- Prioritize ONLY for the UPCOMING WEEK
	- Which of these projects should be taking up the bulk of your bandwidth?
	- Which of these projects should be taking little or none of the bandwidth for this week?
5. Reevaluate your project list
	1. Which goals or priorities you say are important to you don't have any projects associated with them? These are called dreams, since they aren't likely to happen in the near term.
	2. Which projects you are spending a lot of time on don't have any goals associated with them? These are called hobbies, because without a goal in mind they are likely just for fun.
	3. Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify?

### Tips/Reminders:

- Make this 5 step process part of a weekly review
- A project is any endeavor that has a goal and a deadline
- Your only goal in a given week is to make progress on a small handful of projects near the top of the list (usually recommends focusing on 2-3 rather than spreading yourself thin)
- Most people try to do too much - they need to say "no" and focus on the things that matter. Every time you say no to something less important, all that time and effort get freed up to do the things that are more important.

### Evaluation:

**Prioritize:**

- Bulk of my bandwidth should be going to getting Augment Growth direction/structure done so I can unblock making real progress there; be careful not to spread this out over too long - let's try to get an exciting plan in place in the next 10 days (e.g. by 10/3)

**Deprioritize:**

* Do not invest any additional amount of time to PARA/Obsidian structure for now; just get the basics in place to be able to accomplish these top 3 projects
* Rabbit holes on specific agent builds without a clear direction of what I am building and why
* Spending a lot of time on thought leadership pieces

**Re-evaluation of List:**

- I've been spending a TON of time learning about Claude Code recently without a clear goal connected to it, so this is currently more of an interest than a pure project or goal. 
	- Need to determine what role Claude Code is going to play and how I can progress towards achieving my goals by investing more time with it if I plan to spend dedicated time to learning and playing with it.
	- OR I can set aside ~60 mins a week to try out some new capability of Claude Code I'm curious about
- I can postpone housework, pickleball, Claude Code google ads projects, and AI UGC projects potentially. I can also postpone making a website for Augment Growth and just roll with a Gamma slide deck for now to keep it simple and fast to iterate on
