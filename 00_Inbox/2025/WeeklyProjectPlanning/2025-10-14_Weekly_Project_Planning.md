### Process:

1. List all of your current projects
	- Set a timer for 5 minutes and list anything that comes to mind when you hear the following questions:
		1. What's currently worrying you?
		2. What problem is taking you more mental bandwidth than it deserves?
		3. What needs to happen that you are not making consistent progress on?
		4. What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project that you've not yet identified?
		5. What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with?
		6. Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start?
		7. What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting?
2. Add a goal for each project
	- Add a goal for each project on the list
3. Add deadlines or timeframes
	- Add completion dates (doesn't matter whether it's a strict deadline or ideal target date)
4. Prioritize your list
	- Prioritize ONLY for the UPCOMING WEEK
	- Which of these projects should be taking up the bulk of your bandwidth?
	- Which of these projects should be taking little or none of the bandwidth for this week?
5. Reevaluate your project list
	1. Which goals or priorities you say are important to you don't have any projects associated with them? These are called dreams, since they aren't likely to happen in the near term.
	2. Which projects you are spending a lot of time on don't have any goals associated with them? These are called hobbies, because without a goal in mind they are likely just for fun.
	3. Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify?

### Tips/Reminders:

- Make this 5 step process part of a weekly review
- A project is any endeavor that has a goal and a deadline
- Your only goal in a given week is to make progress on a small handful of projects near the top of the list (usually recommends focusing on 2-3 rather than spreading yourself thin)
- Most people try to do too much - they need to say "no" and focus on the things that matter. Every time you say no to something less important, all that time and effort get freed up to do the things that are more important.

### Project List:

1. ==Flesh out the agent systems and workflow SOPs==
	1. I need a clear roadmap of what it is that I plan to build, how it ladders up into the vision of automated customer acquisition, and what each of these agents would do in a little bit more detail so I can start to actually take some of these and implement them in a modular fashion. 
2. Proposal for Burlingame Studios
	1. I need to outline an approach that would be a win-win where I could help build agents for Barlow's company, and where they can help me get clear functional prototypes on the board with the support from their team to use them with live data. This would help me validate the concept for agentic systems
3. ==Get a signed deal with DMS==
	1. This one might require me to have a contract inked and an S-corp already set up so that I can invoice them in advance of doing work. It might require me to rework the proposal a bit if they have feedback. As well as hold and final interviews with their team.
4. LinkedIn post about my claude code setup
	1. Test to see if I can get any interest outlining the use cases for my Claude code setup and why this might be the most underappreciated AI agent for non-technical users. 
5. ~~Get advice on how to stop spinning on the startup concept - DONE~~
	1. ~~I need to ask my network, like Derek and Joe, how to stop spiraling on ideas over and over again and pick something.~~ 
6. Figure out how to implement "marketing workflows" and n8n workflow building into my current claude code master vault
	1. I want to have some live examples of how CC helps me build agents and run workflows

### Evaluation:

**Prioritize:**

- Speaking to clients/prospects/network
- Getting new business with client projects that will let me the build AI systems for Augment Growth and bring in revenue
- Get clarity around which systems I plan to build so I can work that into the pitch at a high level

**Deprioritize:**

* Spinning on new iterations of service offerings and overanalyzing the pros/cons
* Random R&D without an end goal in mind

**Re-evaluation of List:**

- I'm spending a lot of time looking at what other people are building with AI agents rather than building them myself. I'm missing out on the opportunity to show off my own work and learn in the process. (although this is somewhat at odds with the deprioritizing random R&D point above - perhaps the R&D needs to be very intentional?)
- I'm not yet sure if I should do the project for free for Barlow without knowing if I'm giving up other paid work in the meantime, but worth exploring to see if they are in my target market.

### Week in Review

*Completed Tuesday 10/14 (Monday was holiday)*

**Major Accomplishments:**
- **DMS Proposal WIN**: Completed AND sent proposal to Jen Robinson on 10/7 in 2.5 hours (9am-11:30am block)
  - Bonus: Created reusable proposal template for future opportunities
  - Bonus: Built proposal-builder subagent to automate future proposals
- **Network validation calls**: Conducted feedback conversations including David Johnson (10/9, 10/10) and Wyatt Ozmore call (10/10)
- **Owner.com opportunity**: Wyatt call surfaced promising collaboration opportunity (Meta creative acceleration, new channel testing) - follow up by 10/20
- **Maintained consistent deep work blocks**: 10+ hours of protected focus time across the week despite analysis paralysis

**What Worked Well:**
- **Concrete opportunity execution**: When faced with clear scope (DMS proposal), moved fast and delivered quality + extras
- **Calendar discipline**: Successfully blocked and protected focus time throughout the week (morning and afternoon high-energy blocks)
- **Network engagement**: Reconnected with Jen Robinson, had productive conversations with David and Wyatt
- **Pausing to get it right**: Recognized service model needed more validation before pitching widely (resisted premature outreach)

**Challenges & Obstacles:**
- **Analysis paralysis on service line definition**: Spun repeatedly on service offerings (v5 → v6 iterations), changed business model multiple times, lost confidence and clear direction
- **Energy drain from confusion**: Motivation sapped by uncertainty about which direction to pursue (AI systems vs growth consulting vs hybrid)
- **Overthinking vs executing**: Spent significant time on strategy refinement rather than customer-facing action
- **Missed deadlines**: AG pitch (due 10/7-10/8) and agent prioritization (due 10/8) both deferred - perfectionism blocking progress
- **Derek's feedback not yet integrated**: Got advice on 10/14 to stop sweating details and find customers first, but hadn't acted on it yet

**Key Learnings:**
- **"Get off the sidelines from thinking"**: Analysis paralysis is fake work - need to take smaller actions that move forward even if not perfect (from self-assessment)
- **Customer-first approach**: Derek's advice: "Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver" - stop perfecting the service definition
- **Flexibility over perfection**: Need to recognize building Augment Growth will have twists and turns - build brick by brick and adapt in real-time
- **Position as growth consulting, differentiate with AI**: Use AI in the pitch to show how delivery is different and leaves lasting artifacts, but lead with growth expertise
- **DMS win proves execution ability**: When scope is clear, you move fast and deliver quality - the problem isn't execution capability, it's decision clarity
- **Service evolution is normal**: Multiple service iterations based on feedback isn't failure - it's customer-led development (but need to stop spinning at some point)

**Carry Forward to Next Week:**
- **Act on Derek's advice**: Stop spinning on service definitions, go find clients who need customer acquisition help
- **Complete AG pitch (finally)**: Get to shareable one-pager state using v6 insights and Derek's positioning guidance
- **Agent prioritization**: Define the 5 priority agents (due 10/8, now 10/15)
- **Follow up with Wyatt**: Owner.com opportunity - proposal or next call by 10/20
- **S-Corp setup**: Complete incorporation paperwork (due 10/17)
- **Network outreach preparation**: Get pitch ready so week 2 can be about customer conversations, not more strategy work

**Pattern Insights for Daily_Planning_Insights.md:**
- **Time estimation on strategic work**: When work involves decision-making (not just execution), time blocks don't work the same way - decision clarity is the bottleneck, not time allocation
- **Concrete vs ambiguous scope**: DMS proposal (2.5 hours) vs AG pitch (2 weeks spinning) - need clear success criteria for strategic work or it expands infinitely
- **Energy impact of uncertainty**: Noticed motivation and energy were "sapped" when direction unclear - confidence and clarity are energy multipliers
- **Calendar discipline maintained despite confusion**: Even in analysis paralysis, protected focus blocks and maintained schedule - the system works even when content/direction doesn't
- **Two types of consulting prep**: Clear scope = fast execution; Unclear scope = slow iteration - know which you're in and manage accordingly
