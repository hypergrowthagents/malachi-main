## 🚨 Focus Reminders

**From This Week's Learning:**
- You've been doing EXACTLY what weekly planning said: getting network validation
- Service model evolution = good sign you're customer-led, not assumption-led
- DMS proposal win shows your execution is strong when you have clear scope
- Today is about translating all that learning into a shareable artifact

**Today's Strategic Context:**
- **Wyatt call** = potential immediate revenue opportunity (DMS 2.0?)
- **David call** = trusted advisor feedback before wider network push
- **Pitch creation** = unlocks next phase of customer validation & sales
- **This is setup work for next week's outreach blitz**

**Energy Optimization:**
- Use post-David low-energy window for lunch/walk/processing
- Save afternoon high-energy for creative pitch work
- Meeting-heavy morning is fine (fits your standard pattern)

---

## 📋 Deferred Items

**Not Today (But Soon):**
- Agent prioritization (5 agents) - Due 10/8, carry to tomorrow
- Network outreach list expansion (20 contacts) - Due today, but pitch needs to be ready first
- Content calendar planning - Lower priority per weekly eval
- Gamma slides version - After one-pager validated

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Can't do effective network outreach without solid pitch
- Better to have great one-pager than rushed Gamma slides
- Agent prioritization less urgent than revenue-generating activities
- Content follows business model clarity (not before)

---

## 💡 LinkedIn Content Idea

**Potential Post Theme:** "How customer validation changes your business model in real-time"
- Started with Service_Offerings_v5
- Network conversations revealed different pain points
- Iterated to v6 based on actual customer needs
- The messy middle of customer discovery
- Why this discomfort = you're doing it right

*This is real-time founder content - authentic, vulnerable, tactical*

**OR:** "Two types of consulting wins"
- DMS: Clear scope, fast execution, sent proposal in 2.5 hours
- AG: Unclear scope, slow iteration, taking 2 weeks to nail the pitch
- Both are valuable, they just require different approaches
- Know which type you're in
