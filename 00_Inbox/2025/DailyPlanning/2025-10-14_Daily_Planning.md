# Daily Planning - 2025-10-14

*Breaking through analysis paralysis - action over perfection*

---

## üìä Weekly Project Context
*Pulled from: [[2025-10-14_Weekly_Project_Planning]]*

### Derek Steer's Core Advice (received today):
1. **Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver**
2. Position as **growth consulting** focused on customer acquisition
3. Use AI as the **differentiator in the pitch** - show how you'll use it differently and leave lasting artifacts
4. Do this a few times and learn from there
5. **Stop sweating the service definition details** - "go find clients, then that other stuff is going to just shake out"

### Top Priorities This Week:
1. **Flesh out agent systems/workflow SOPs** by 10/15
2. **Create draft pitch for Augment Growth** by 10/14 (TODAY - finally!)
3. **S-Corp setup** by 10/17
4. **DMS follow ups** to close deal by 10/17
5. **Email to Fara/Zuben** about consulting project by 10/16

### Your Self-Assessment from Weekend:
"I need to figure out some smaller actions that I can take that move me forward in some way. It doesn't have to be perfect. I just need to get started and build this thing brick by brick and give myself the ability to capture learnings and adapt in real-time."

## üéØ Today's Big 3 - ACTION OVER PERFECTION

### Priority #1: **Create Simple One-Pager Pitch (Derek's Way)**
**Time Block:** 12:00-2:30pm (LOW ENERGY - this is intentional!)
**Why low energy?** You're overthinking this. Use lower energy time to FORCE simplicity and speed.

**Task: Create 1-page pitch in 90 minutes MAX**
Following Derek's advice - lead with growth consulting, differentiate with AI:

**Required sections (THAT'S IT):**
1. **Who I help**: Seed-Series B companies struggling with customer acquisition (1 sentence)
2. **What I do**: Growth consulting focused on paid acquisition - with AI-powered processes that stick (2 sentences)
3. **How it's different**: Leave you with working AI systems, not just recommendations (1 sentence)
4. **Example deliverables**: 3-5 specific AI workflows (bullet list)
5. **Pricing**: $15-25k for 90-day engagement (1 line)
6. **Call to action**: "Looking for 2-3 pilot clients to test this with" (1 sentence)

**Success Criteria:**
- Pitch EXISTS and fits on one page
- Uses growth consulting language Derek suggested
- Shareable TODAY (even if rough)
- NO MORE THAN 90 MINUTES on this

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Don't open your Service_Offerings docs. Don't re-read your notes. Just WRITE from Derek's framework.

---

### Priority #2: **Send Pitch to 3 Real People**
**Time Block:** 2:30-3:30pm (HIGH ENERGY - execute!)
**Why:** Stop preparing to pitch. Start pitching.

**Task: Identify 3 contacts and send pitch TODAY**
- Wyatt Ozmore (Owner.com - you already talked, follow up with framework)
- David Johnson (already gave feedback, close the loop)
- One more from your network who needs customer acquisition help

**Message format (keep simple):**
"Hey [Name], following up on our conversation. I've clarified my offering - helping companies with customer acquisition using growth consulting + AI-powered processes. Does this resonate? Would love 15 min to get your thoughts. [Attach one-pager]"

**Success Criteria:**
- 3 messages sent TODAY
- Pitch document shared
- Follow-up calls scheduled (if they respond)

---

### Priority #3: **Flesh Out Agent Systems & Workflow SOPs**
**Time Block:** 3:30-5:00pm (HIGH ENERGY - 90 minutes)
**Why:** Top priority for this week (due 10/15), foundation for client work

**Task: Create the agent systems roadmap document**
Per your weekly priorities - this needs to answer:
1. What agents/workflows you plan to build (master list)
2. How they ladder up to automated customer acquisition vision
3. Which 5 to prioritize first (align with customer acquisition pitch)
4. What each priority agent does (1-paragraph description)
5. Agent vs human decision framework (when to automate vs delegate)

**Success Criteria:**
- Master list of potential agents/workflows documented
- First 5 agents prioritized with clear rationale
- Brief SOP outline for each priority agent (input ‚Üí process ‚Üí output)
- Saved in `02_Areas/AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT/Agent_Systems_Roadmap.md`
- This becomes reference doc for client conversations

**Connection to pitch:** These 5 priority agents become your "example deliverables" section in the one-pager

---

1. ‚úÖ One-pager pitch EXISTS (even if rough)
2. ‚úÖ Sent to at least 2 people (Wyatt + David minimum)

## üö® Focus Reminders

**Derek's Advice (repeat as needed):**
"Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver. Go find clients, then that other stuff is going to just shake out."

**Your Own Words (from weekend):**
"I need to get off the sidelines from just thinking about things (which is effectively like fake work)."

**Today's Mission:**
STOP PREPARING. START PITCHING.

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Opening Service_Offerings v5, v6, or any other version
- Re-reading all your notes and research
- Perfecting the pitch before sending it
- Waiting for "one more conversation" before acting
- Making a Gamma slides version (that's later, after validation)

**What Breaking Through Looks Like:**
- Pitch created in 90 minutes (not 2 weeks)
- Sent to real people TODAY (not "when it's perfect")
- Responses coming back by end of week
- Learning from actual customer conversations (not hypotheticals)

---

## üìã Deferred Items (Not Today)

**Explicitly NOT doing:**
- Gamma slides version of pitch (after validation with one-pager)
- Service line analysis (DONE. Use Derek's framework.)
- Financial model updates (not blocking pitch)
- S-Corp paperwork (due 10/17, tomorrow)
- Content calendar (deprioritized)
- Full workflow implementation (just roadmap/SOPs today)

**Why:** Focus on the minimum to unblock customer conversations and have a reference doc for pitching.

---

## üí° Mindset Reset

**From Derek:** You're an expert at customer acquisition. You have 10+ years of experience. People need help. Stop sweating how you'll deliver before you find them.

**From You:** Build this brick by brick. It doesn't have to be perfect. Capture learnings and adapt.

**From Calendar Data:** You delivered DMS proposal in 2.5 hours when you had clarity. You can deliver a pitch in 90 minutes with the same clarity.

**Today's Mantra:** "Done is better than perfect. Pitching beats planning."
