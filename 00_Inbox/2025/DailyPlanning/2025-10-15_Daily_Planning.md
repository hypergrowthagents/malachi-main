# Daily Planning - 2025-10-15

*Building on yesterday's momentum - action continues*

---

## üìä Weekly Project Context
*Pulled from: [[2025-10-14_Weekly_Project_Planning]]*

### Yesterday's Breakthrough (10/14):
- ‚úÖ Created and shipped Pitch_v2 in one session
- ‚úÖ Sent to 4 people (Terry, Derek, Barlow, David)
- ‚úÖ DMS interview with Rick Fox - he wants to move forward
- ‚úÖ Momentum shift: Analysis ‚Üí Action

### Derek's Framework (now validated):
"Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver. Go find clients, then that other stuff is going to just shake out."

### Top Priorities This Week:
1. **Flesh out agent systems/workflow SOPs** by 10/15 (TODAY - deferred from yesterday)
2. ‚úÖ ~~Create draft pitch for Augment Growth~~ by 10/14 (DONE)
3. **DMS follow ups** to close deal by 10/17
4. **Email to Fara/Zuben** about consulting project by 10/16
5. **Generate standard consultant contract** (NEW - need for DMS deal)

## üéØ Today's Big 3

### Priority #1: **Agent Systems Roadmap & SOPs (DUE TODAY)**
**Time Block:** 9:00am-12:00pm (HIGH ENERGY - 3 hours)
**Why:** Top weekly priority, foundation for client conversations, due 10/15

**Task: Create comprehensive agent systems roadmap**
This document needs to answer (per weekly priorities):
1. **Master list** of potential agents/workflows you could build
2. **Vision alignment**: How they ladder up to automated customer acquisition
3. **Prioritize first 5 agents** aligned with your pitch deliverables
4. **Agent descriptions**: 1-paragraph for each priority agent (what it does, value prop)
5. **Agent vs human framework**: When to automate vs delegate

**Structure for the document:**
```
## Vision: Automated Customer Acquisition System
[2-3 sentences on how these agents work together]

## Master List of Potential Agents/Workflows
[Braindump - all ideas, categorized by growth discipline]

## Priority 5 Agents (Phase 1)
For each agent:
- Name & one-line description
- What problem it solves
- Input ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output (SOP outline)
- Why prioritized (client value + feasibility)

## Agent vs Human Decision Framework
[When to build agent vs hire human]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Saved as `02_Areas/AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT/Agent_Systems_Roadmap.md`
- Master list is comprehensive (15-20+ potential agents)
- First 5 agents have clear SOP outlines
- This becomes your reference doc when pitching clients
- Can point clients to specific agents that solve their problems

---

### Priority #2: **Draft Standard Consultant Contract**
**Time Block:** 2:30-3:30pm (HIGH ENERGY - 60 minutes)
**Why:** Need this ready for DMS deal and future client work

**Task: Create reusable consulting services agreement template**

**Required sections:**
1. Services & Scope of Work (template with placeholders)
2. Term & Termination (90-day engagement standard, termination clauses)
3. Compensation & Payment Terms (milestone-based, net-30 standard)
4. Intellectual Property (work product ownership, AI systems/code)
5. Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure
6. Independent Contractor Status
7. Limitation of Liability
8. Governing Law

**Approach:**
- Research standard consulting contract templates (use WebSearch for 2025 best practices)
- Customize for AI/growth consulting context
- Make sections modular (easy to swap scope/pricing per client)
- Have placeholders for: [Client Name], [Project Scope], [Fee], [Start Date], [Deliverables]

**Success Criteria:**
- Saved as `02_Areas/BUSINESS_DEVELOPMENT/Templates/Standard_Consulting_Agreement_Template.md`
- Ready to customize for DMS when Rick/Jen confirm next steps
- Can be reused for future consulting engagements
- Includes AI-specific IP considerations

---

### Priority #3: **Follow Up on Pitch Responses & DMS Progress**

## üö® Focus Reminders

**Yesterday's Win:**
You broke through 2 weeks of analysis paralysis by creating and shipping pitch in ONE DAY. Keep that momentum.

**Today's Mission:**
Build the operational foundation (agent roadmap, contract template) while keeping deals moving forward.

**Derek's Wisdom:**
"Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver."
- You're finding customers ‚úÖ (pitch sent to 4 people)
- Now document what you'll deliver (agent roadmap)
- Have contract ready when they say yes (template today)

**Energy Management:**
- Use morning HIGH ENERGY for the hard stuff (agent roadmap, contract drafting)
- Use afternoon HIGH ENERGY for strategic communication (Fara/Zuben email)
- Keep momentum from yesterday - action beats analysis

---

## üìã Deferred Items (Not Today)

**Explicitly NOT doing:**
- S-Corp paperwork (blocked on tax advisor)
- Full agent implementation (just roadmap/SOPs today)
- Gamma slides for pitch (after more validation)
- Financial model updates (not blocking current deals)
- Content calendar (deprioritized)

**Why:** Focus on what unblocks client work and deal closure.

---

## üí° Mindset for Today

**From Yesterday's Success:**
- Pitch created in ONE session (vs 2 weeks of spinning)
- Sent to 4 people immediately (action over perfection)
- DMS interview success (Rick wants to move forward)

**Today's Approach:**
Same energy. Create comprehensive agent roadmap in 3 hours (full morning deep work). Draft contract in 60 minutes. Ship both. Don't overthink.

**Momentum Principle:**
Yesterday you started customer conversations. Today you build the foundation to deliver. Tomorrow you close deals.
