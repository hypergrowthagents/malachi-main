## 📋 Task Flow & Dependencies

### Critical Success Path:
1. **Augment Offerings FIRST** → Enables financial model updates
2. **Financial Model SECOND** → Uses completed service definitions
3. **MAVAN Post LAST** → Quick execution, no dependencies

### Key Constraints:
- **Time constraint**: Only today available before Thu-Fri break
- **Dependency**: Financial model requires completed service offerings
- **Energy optimization**: High-energy work in 9:30-12pm and 2-4pm blocks

---

## 🚦 Dependencies & Blockers

**None Identified:**
- All tasks are self-contained with existing resources
- No external dependencies blocking progress

**Potential Obstacles:**
- Perfectionism on service offerings (limit scope to "good enough to test")
- Time management with only one work day available

---

## 📊 Daily Metrics

**Energy Level Target:** 9-10 for focus blocks
**Available Deep Work:** 4 hours (2.25hrs + 1.5hrs)
**Key Success Metric:** All 3 priorities completed before break
**Constraint:** No flexibility to extend beyond today

## 📋 Next Week Action Items
**Added from ICP validation analysis:**
- [ ] **Customer Discovery Interviews**: Schedule and conduct interviews with 15+ seed stage founders to validate AI pain points and pricing assumptions (Due: 10/3)
  - Validate pricing sensitivity ($2k-3.5k monthly range)
  - Test decision maker authority (CEO vs other roles)
  - Confirm pain point intensity around talent shortages
  - Assess competitive alternatives being evaluated

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria for End of Day

**By 4:00pm, you must have:**
1. ✅ **Completed service offerings** ready for client validation
2. ✅ **Published MAVAN departure post** on LinkedIn
3. ✅ **Updated financial model** with new service structure

**Business Impact:** This completes the foundation for Augment Growth service validation phase and maintains momentum through strategic break.

---

## 🚨 Focus Reminders

- **Augment Offerings**: Aim for "validation-ready" not "perfect"
- **Financial Model**: Basic framework sufficient, detailed scenarios later
- **MAVAN Post**: Trust existing 90% draft, minimal edits needed

**Daily Accountability Question:** *What's preventing each of these 3 items from being completed today, and how can I remove those obstacles right now?*

---

## 🔄 Learning Insights for Tomorrow

**Process Observations:**
- Calendar-first approach provides clear structure and accountability
- 7-day planning gap didn't derail project progress due to clear weekly priorities
- Energy-optimized scheduling aligns well with actual work patterns

**Tomorrow's Setup:**
Next planning session: Monday 9/30 (after Thu-Fri break)
