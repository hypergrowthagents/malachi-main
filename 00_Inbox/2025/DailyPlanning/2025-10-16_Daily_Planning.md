### Priority #2: **Outline Systems and Priority Workflows (Agent Roadmap)**
**Time Block:** 10:45am-12:00pm (1.25 hrs) + 2:30-5:00pm (2.5 hrs) = **3.75 hours total**
**Why:** Foundation for client conversations, overdue from 10/15, critical for defining what you're selling

**Task: Create comprehensive agent systems roadmap and workflow SOPs**

This document needs to answer:
1. **Master list** of potential agents/workflows you could build
2. **Vision alignment**: How they ladder up to automated customer acquisition
3. **Prioritize first 5 agents** aligned with your pitch deliverables
4. **Agent descriptions**: 1-paragraph for each priority agent (what it does, value prop)
5. **Workflow SOPs**: Input ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output for each priority agent
6. **Agent vs human framework**: When to automate vs delegate

**Morning Session (10:45am-12pm - 1.25 hours):**
- [ ] Create file: `02_Areas/AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT/Agent_Systems_Roadmap.md`
- [ ] Write vision statement (how agents ladder to automated customer acquisition)
- [ ] Braindump master list - comprehensive (organized by: Paid Acquisition, Creative, Analytics, Conversion, Lifecycle)
- [ ] Select first 5 priority agents (align with pitch deliverables)

**Afternoon Session (2:30-5pm - 2.5 hours):**
- [ ] For each of 5 priority agents: detailed description, problem solved, value prop
- [ ] For each priority agent: full SOP outline (input‚Üíprocess‚Üíoutput, tools needed, success metrics)
- [ ] Document agent vs human decision framework
- [ ] Proofread, refine, finalize

**Structure for the document:**
```
## Vision: Automated Customer Acquisition System
[2-3 sentences on how these agents work together]

## Master List of Potential Agents/Workflows
[Braindump - all ideas, categorized by growth discipline]

## Priority 5 Agents (Phase 1)
For each agent:
- Name & one-line description
- What problem it solves
- Input ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Output (SOP outline)
- Why prioritized (client value + feasibility)

## Agent vs Human Decision Framework
[When to build agent vs hire human]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Comprehensive master list (15-20+ potential agents)
- First 5 agents have clear SOP outlines
- This becomes your reference doc when pitching clients
- Can point clients to specific agents that solve their problems

### Priority #3: **Meeting with Brock Andersen - S-Corp Setup**
**Time Block:** 10:00-10:30am (SCHEDULED)
**Why:** Tax advisor finally recovered, need to complete S-Corp formation (due 10/17)

**Agenda:**
- Confirm S-Corp structure makes sense for Augment Growth
- Understand next steps and timeline for formation
- Get clarity on what documents/decisions you need to provide
- Understand tax implications and quarterly requirements
- Ask about invoicing best practices (relevant for DMS deal)

**Pre-meeting prep:**
- Have questions ready about DMS contract timing (when to invoice)
- Clarify if you can start consulting work before S-Corp is fully formed

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear action items for S-Corp completion
- Timeline for when S-Corp will be operational
- Understand if this blocks DMS work or if you can proceed

**Post-Meeting:**
- Brock will likely provide specific action items for S-Corp formation
- These actions may need to be prioritized today or tomorrow
- Assess urgency and slot into today's schedule if critical, otherwise plan for 10/17

## üö® Focus Reminders

**Monday's Win:**
You broke through analysis paralysis by creating and shipping pitch v2 in one day, sent to 4 people.

**Yesterday's Win:**
You got valuable feedback from Sawyer and Terry, refined pitch to v2.1, created gaming-specific version for Barlow (who responded positively and is discussing pilot with co-founder).

**Today's Mission:**
Tighten the pitch with Derek's feedback (morning), then build the operational foundation (agent roadmap) that defines WHAT you're actually selling.

**Derek's Wisdom (from 10/14):**
"Find the customer first, then worry about how to deliver."
- You're finding customers ‚úÖ (Barlow interested in pilot, Derek has project today)
- Now document what you'll deliver (agent roadmap TODAY)
- Feedback loop is working - pitch getting better with each conversation

**Energy Management:**
- Use morning HIGH ENERGY for pitch refinement (creative, strategic)
- Use pre-lunch HIGH ENERGY to START systems work (braindump, creative)
- Use afternoon HIGH ENERGY for systems COMPLETION (detailed SOPs)
- Keep momentum - you're building real opportunities now

---

## üìã Deferred Items (Conditional)

**Explicitly NOT doing (unless urgent):**
- Consultant contract template (not blocking any current deals)
- Full agent implementation (just roadmap/SOPs today)
- Gamma slides for pitch (after more validation)
- Financial model updates (not blocking current deals)
- Content calendar (deprioritized)

**May be added today based on Brock meeting:**
- S-Corp formation action items (if time-sensitive, will slot into afternoon or evening)
- Otherwise deferred to 10/17 as priority

**Why:** Focus on what unblocks client work and clarifies what you're selling, with flexibility for critical S-Corp tasks.

---

## üí° Mindset for Today

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Pitch v2 created in ONE day ‚Üí sent to 4 people ‚Üí getting refined through feedback
- Same approach today: Tighten pitch in 60 min, build agent roadmap in 3.75 hours
- Action beats analysis - ship, get feedback, iterate

**Opportunity Momentum:**
- Barlow: Gaming pitch received well, discussing pilot with co-founder
- Derek: Has a potential project to discuss today
- DMS: Still waiting but deal is warm
- Sawyer: Partnership opportunities identified

**Today's Approach:**
Morning: Tighten the story (pitch v2.2)
Afternoon: Define the delivery (agent roadmap)
Result: Clear positioning + concrete offerings = ready to close deals
