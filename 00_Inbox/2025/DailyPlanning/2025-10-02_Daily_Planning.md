## ⏰ Time Block Schedule

### Morning: Kids' Field Trip
**7:00am - 2:00pm: Volunteering at kids' field trip**
- Family commitment - no work time available
- Enjoy the time with the kids!

### Afternoon: Focused Work Window (Compressed)
**2:00pm - 5:00pm: Financial Model Completion Sprint (3 hours)**
- **Energy Level: HIGH** - Second high-energy window of day
- **Constraint**: Compressed timeline requires focus and efficiency
- **Strategy**: Critical path items first (error fixes → Conservative scenario validation)

#### Suggested Breakdown:
**2:00pm - 2:15pm**: Transition & Setup (15 min)
- Review ClaudeAnalysis_v7_Model_Feedback.md
- Identify exact errors to fix
- Set clear priorities for 3-hour window

**2:15pm - 3:30pm**: Phase 1 - Error Resolution (75 min)
- Fix Google Sheets upload errors
- Resolve any formula issues
- Get clean upload working
- **Success check**: Model uploads without errors

**3:30pm - 4:45pm**: Phase 2 - Core Validation (75 min)
- **Priority 1**: Validate Conservative scenario (most critical)
- **Priority 2**: Validate Realistic scenario
- **Priority 3**: Spot-check Optimistic scenario (if time allows)
- Focus on unit economics across key client counts
- **Success check**: Conservative scenario numbers make sense

**4:45pm - 5:00pm**: Phase 3 - Wrap-up & Documentation (15 min)
- Quick QA pass on what's complete
- Note remaining items for weekend/Monday
- Update status in project folder
- Call it done for the day

### Realistic Outcome Assessment:
**Full completion**: Possible if errors resolve quickly
**More likely**: 75-85% complete with polish items deferred
**Success metric**: Model is functional and usable for decision-making, even if not 100% polished
**Weekend plan**: Option to finish remaining items Saturday/Sunday if needed
