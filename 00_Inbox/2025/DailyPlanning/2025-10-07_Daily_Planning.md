## üö® Focus Reminders

**From Yesterday's Session:**
- You have medium-high bandwidth and no major constraints this week
- Service line uncertainty being addressed through exploration + validation
- Consulting opportunities (DMS) are top priority alongside AG development

**Today's Priorities:**
1. **DMS proposal** = concrete revenue opportunity (highest priority)
2. **AG pitch draft** = unlocks network validation conversations
3. Both enable forward progress on determining service line direction

**Energy Optimization:**
- Use morning high-energy for DMS proposal (most important)
- Use afternoon high-energy for creative AG pitch work
- Both are strategic work suited to high-energy periods

---

## üìã Deferred Items

**Not Today:**
- Agent prioritization (due 10/8 - can tackle tomorrow)
- Network outreach list (due 10/10 - later this week)
- Content calendar planning (lower priority per weekly eval)
- LinkedIn content pillars (deprioritized this week)

**Reason:** Focus on concrete opportunities and foundational pitch work first

## üí° LinkedIn Content Idea

**Potential Post Theme:** "How customer conversations shape service design"
- Started with one AG direction (Service_Offerings_v5)
- DMS interview revealed alternative angle (in-house AI capabilities)
- Network validation will determine final direction
- The power of staying flexible and customer-led

*Draft after completing DMS proposal - real-time insight makes authentic content*
