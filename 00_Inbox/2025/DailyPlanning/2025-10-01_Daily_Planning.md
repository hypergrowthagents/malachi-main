## 📋 Task Flow & Dependencies

### Critical Success Path:
1. **Morning Block** (10:55-12pm) → Core model structure and pricing
2. **Afternoon Block** (1:30-2pm) → Scenario analysis and finalization
3. **EOD Deliverable** → Model ready for Terri by 2:00pm

### Key Constraints:
- **Limited window**: Only 1.5 hours total focus time (started late at 10:20am)
- **Hard deadline**: Kid pickup at 2:30pm, work ends at 2:00pm
- **Energy trade-off**: Lower-energy afternoon period, but adequate for model completion

### Tomorrow's Foundation:
- Financial model complete → Unblocks pitch draft work
- Sawyer insights captured → May inform pitch messaging

---

## 🚦 Dependencies & Blockers

**None Identified:**
- Financial model has existing structure, just needs updates
- Service_Offerings_v4 provides clear input data
- All resources available and accessible

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Focused scope: "good enough for Terri review" not "perfect final version"
- Core updates in morning high-energy block
- Quick finalization in afternoon to meet deadline

---

## 📊 Daily Metrics

**Energy Level:** 9/10 (good focus capacity)
**Available Deep Work:** 1.5 hours (compressed window)
**Key Success Metric:** Financial model draft sent to Terri by 2:00pm
**Constraint:** Late start + early kid pickup = tight execution window

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria for End of Day

**By 2:00pm, you must have:**
1. ✅ **Sawyer interview completed** with insights captured
2. ✅ **Financial model draft complete** and ready for Terri review
3. ✅ **Model sent to Terri** via email/Slack for feedback

**Business Impact:** Completes Week 1 foundation work, unblocks network interview phase next week, validates service offering economics.

---

## 🚨 Focus Reminders

- **Financial Model Goal**: "Ready for feedback" not "perfect final version"
- **Scope Control**: Focus on core pricing scenarios, detailed sensitivity later
- **Execution Speed**: Tight window requires decisive updates, no perfectionism
- **Tomorrow Setup**: Pitch draft moves to Oct 2 with full day available

**Daily Accountability Question:** *What's the minimum viable update to make this model useful for Terri's review?*

---

## 📋 Deferred to Tomorrow (Oct 2)

**Pitch Draft Development:**
- Create text/outline structure for slide deck
- Use Service_Offerings_v4 as foundation
- Incorporate any insights from Sawyer interview

---

## 🔄 Learning Insights Captured

**Process Observations:**
- Late start (10:20am vs 9:30am) required immediate plan adjustment

- Single priority approach better for compressed time windows
- Calendar-first approach maintains accountability despite constraints

**Tomorrow's Planning Notes:**
- Resume normal energy-optimized schedule (9am start)
- Pitch draft has full day available (no kid pickup conflicts)
