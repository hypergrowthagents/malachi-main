### Business Transition & Structure

- Left Maven after 4.5 years (consulting + W2 employee/partner)
- Launched Augment Growth - AI-native growth operations for early-stage consumer subscription startups
- Currently pre-revenue, seeking clients
  - 75% probability on $25k/month deal (3 days/week)
  - Several 5-10k opportunities in pipeline
  - Goal: $20k+/month within 2.5 months

### AI Growth Operations Approach

- Two-tier service model:
  - Traditional fractional Head of Growth/CMO role
  - AI agent implementation and training overlay
- Building system of AI agents for performance marketing tasks:
  - Ad creative generation
  - Campaign analysis and reporting
  - Anomaly detection with Slack alerts
  - Optimization and test completion detection
- Using Claude Code as primary platform vs. narrow point solutions
  - More sophisticated and customizable
  - Client-specific documentation and knowledge integration
  - Co-building approach with discounted pilot clients
- Advantage: Cross-client exposure creates broader use case knowledge

### Tax Structure & Next Steps

- Recommended: LLC with S-Corp election (same as previous setup)
- Threshold analysis: $10k revenue in 2025 makes S-Corp advantageous
- California PTE tax election no longer necessary due to increased SALT deduction limit ($40k)
- Potential future consideration: Kids on payroll (ages 7&5, wait until 8+ years old)
- Monthly fee: $250 (up from previous rate)
- Chase banking setup can be reactivated with existing credentials
- Onboarding link to be sent within 5-10 minutes, followed by setup call
