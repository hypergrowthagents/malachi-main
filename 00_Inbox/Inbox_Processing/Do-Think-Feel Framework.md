The **Do-Think-Feel** (often called "Think-Feel-Do") framework is a widely used communication, marketing, and messaging tool designed to clarify the intent behind any message or campaign. The idea is to shape communication by addressing three categories for your audience:

1. **Think**: What do you want your audience to _understand_ or _believe_ after engaging with your message?
    
    - This is the rational/cognitive layer, focusing on what facts or knowledge you want them to retain (e.g., "These guys know their stuff" or "I didn’t know that before.").
        
2. **Feel**: What emotion do you want your audience to _experience_ as a result?
    
    - This is the emotional layer, seeking to influence audience feelings like being inspired, supported, or concerned. Emotional connection is key for engagement and brand loyalty.
        
3. **Do**: What _action_ do you want your audience to take?
    
    - This behavioral layer is about the specific, tangible next step you want them to perform—like signing up, clicking, sharing, or providing feedback. Clarity about the intended action helps drive outcomes.
        

**Why use it?**

- This framework helps you work backward from the outcome you want, ensuring your messaging is purposeful and results in the desired audience shift in knowledge, emotion, and behavior.
    
- It's popular in branding, internal communications, marketing, proposal writing, and product launches because it brings clarity and intention to messaging, avoiding generic or scattered information.speakap+4​
    

**Example**:

- After reading your proposal, what do you want the reader to **think** ("This is a fresh, credible approach"), **feel** ("I’m excited to work with these people"), and **do** ("Contact them for a partnership").authenticcomms+1​
