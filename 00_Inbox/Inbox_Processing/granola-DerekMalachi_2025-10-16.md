### Superframe Product Overview

- Building CRM/data organization platform targeting “single pane of glass” for customer journey visibility
- Core value prop: Consolidates all go-to-market signals (marketing, sales, support, product usage)
  - Takes Fireflies/Gong transcripts, emails, LinkedIn messages, support tickets, billing data
  - Deduplicates events (calendly invite + calendar event + transcript = one consolidated record)
  - Organizes by account with timeline visualization showing communication frequency/recency
- Not competing directly with HubSpot - focuses on data organization, not record keeping or automation
  - Attaches to existing CRM records rather than replacing them
  - Avoids deal management, renewals, workflow automation

### Market Positioning & Freemium Strategy

- Phase 1: “Free Gong” - basic conversation organization and timeline views
  - Targeting solopreneurs/small teams who can’t afford $25k/year Gong pricing
  - Fireflies user base (16M users, 300k businesses) as foundation for freemium model
- Revenue model: Eventually charge on volume metrics, similar to Dropbox approach
  - Brand halo effect more valuable than forcing early monetization
  - Enterprise upsell: Teams already using product get corporate controls/features
- Integration strategy: Start with Google Sheets/Notion, build toward Salesforce/HubSpot
  - Focus on SDK/platform approach for third-party integration development
  - Leverage external dev shops for rapid integration scaling

### Technical Development Approach

- Two-phase conversational AI features planned:
  - Account-level queries (“When did we last discuss pricing with X?”)
  - Segment/aggregate analysis (SMB vs Enterprise trends)
- Platform strategy: Enable developer integrations through robust SDK
  - Target Y Combinator-type teams who can build custom pushes
  - Use Claude/AI to replicate integration patterns across similar tools
- Third-party integration prioritization using Zapier and partner pipelines
  - 80/20 approach: Focus development on highest-usage connections first

### Next Steps

- Google security review required before launch (few weeks timeline)
- Derek will provide early access for product testing and feedback
- Follow-up call planned to discuss additional topics
