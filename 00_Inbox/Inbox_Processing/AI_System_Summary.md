# AI System and Agent Priorities - Summary

## ICPs & Use Cases

1. **100→1000 scaling**: Companies with existing channels/data who need to scale existing growth programs
2. **0→1 building**: Companies starting new channels or lacking internal growth resources

- Significant overlap allows for channel audits and hybrid strategies

## Core Value Props

- **Scale with lean teams**: 1 person does the work of 5
- **Move faster than competitors**: Learn and grow faster through AI systems

## Key Market Gaps AI Won't Solve

1. Lack of deep growth marketing expertise/best practices
2. Missing full business context and proprietary knowledge
3. Companies want experts to run systems for them (not DIY tools)

## The 4 Core AI Systems

### 1. Strategy System - "Head of Growth Marketing"

**Purpose**: Answer "What should we do next?" **Key Workflows**:

- Competitive channel research (SimilarWeb, Data.ai)
- Media plans and channel audits
- Experimentation roadmaps (creative, landing pages, audiences) **Human/AI Split**: 50/50 - mostly augmented, not replaced

### 2. Creative Production - "The Creative Producer"

**Purpose**: Generate marketing assets (static, video, copy, wireframes) **Key Workflows**:

- Competitive ad analysis/deconstruction
- Winning ad variant generation & format conversion
- Testing roadmap → static image matrix
- Product URL → creative concepts
- Concept → detailed creative briefs (static/video)
- Ad creative prediction engine
- Keyword → search copy generation (Google RSAs)
- Brand enforcement QA
- Channel-specific optimization agents
- Clip assembly/disassembly

**Goal**: High quantity of on-brand, conversion-optimized creatives aligned to specific channels

### 3. Data Analysis - "The Data Analyst"

**Purpose**: Surface insights and patterns from performance data **Characteristics**: Deterministic, fact-based, long-term memory of learnings **Key Workflows**:

- KPI dashboard (executive-level trends)
- Channel comparison & budget reallocation analysis
- Campaign analysis (period-over-period anomaly detection)
- Attribution variance analysis
- Creative testing statistical significance
- Weekly performance reports (automated)
- Experimentation learnings library
- Conversion funnel analysis by segment

### 4. Optimization - "The Performance Marketer"

**Key Workflows**:

- Platform-specific optimization (Meta, Google, TikTok)
- Audience planning (Meta, TikTok)
- Search keyword planning

## Guiding Principles

1. **Everything is text** - Convert all media to text for LLM ingestion
2. **Humans own high-stakes tasks** - Anything requiring judgment, taste, or high risk/importance
3. **Modular building blocks** - Create reusable "legos not castles" to reduce brittleness
4. **Documentation first** - Manual workflows → SOPs → automation (design for edge cases upfront)
