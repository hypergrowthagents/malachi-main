Purpose: the purpose of this doc is to get some ramblings down on paper about how I can combine the intersection of growth consulting and the AI work that I'm doing into a cohesive narrative because it's a little bit confusing exactly where one begins and the other ends. I'm going to share some thoughts below that I have as well as a conversation that I was having with a friend. 

## Malachi thoughts

I'm building a new offering that is fractional growth consulting combined with implementing advanced AI capabilities in one package. 

You hire me for two reasons:

 1. Because I can help your company solve growth
 2. Because I can help your company unlock AI capabilities that you can then continue to leverage in perpetuity 

You want both the strategy and the operational leverage. 

On the consulting side, I am your fractional VP of growth. Fractional consulting is not a new thing. It's been providing value for companies who need strategic support and value the wisdom and lessons learned from experienced operators, but perhaps don't have the model proven out enough to need a full-time position or want to augment their capabilities in the short term while they find their forever growth person. In addition to helping startups develop their growth strategy and refine their growth marketing execution, I build and oversee AI agents and manage their outputs.

What's new with this model is that I bring in a multitude of specialized agents that I have either built or sourced through leading tools in order to significantly accelerate the speed with which a growth marketing team can operate and allow a startup to essentially have one person or a couple of people that can take on the work that used to require a full team. By augmenting themselves with agents that can do a lot of the heavy lifting and lean on humans for what human expertise does best. 

In addition to helping lead growth strategy, I'll be overseeing a team of agents and working with your internal team to teach and enable them to use these agents as well. So that this becomes an internal capability. The systems that will be implemented are referenced here. 

[[AI_System_Summary]] [[AI_System and Agent Priorities - MR Notes]] 

By the end of our engagement, you should have:

 • Clear growth maps and roadmaps
 • Analysis of your main problems and key opportunities
 • An internal team that is executing against those priorities using growth best practices
 • AI agents that are embedded into your workflows and that the team knows how to use
 • The internal knowledge to continue to build and refine agents of your own so that you can continue to scale, leveraging a combination of internal resourcing and AI agents that you expand into 

## David Johnson Advice

exactly, so—then I think you sell yourself as a VP of Growth—outline your competencies and list it as one of them, leave it at that

the package is the solution to the problem you're solving—that you, as a VP of Growth, can solve because you have extensive experience + you can do it in less time than it takes an avg growth person and for less than an agency

unify as one—sell your growth experience, VP = cost vs comparable solution, services = what they can expect

value prop = vp

The argument is that the work you'd do as just a VP of growth, you'd augment/do using AI anyhow (or aim to)...and then, when you had multiple examples of doing it and the improvements, maybe then you make it the selling prop

But either way, if the goal is to do vp growth work as a fractional, why limit yourself to doing just AI implementation? Unless that's the only type of worm that interests you
