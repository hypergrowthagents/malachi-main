## Distillation: 
I should set up a product for prospects, or lead magnet, that I can use to offer to prospective customers for cheap or free that will directly lead them to want to hire me. 

## Ideas: 
(To be fleshed out)
1. Architecture of the AI system design (which agents and workflows you need to build)
2. AI effectiveness assessment - fill out a questionnaire that will determine how effectively they or their team is using Ai in their growth stack
3. Starter workflows - give away a few of the core workflows for free
4. Trial run of AI capabilities - get access to run a couple of the agents on their own to get a taste of the results. For example, the ICP builder

Daniel Priestley emphasizes the importance of the "Product for Prospects" (PFP) as a critical step toward achieving seven-figure revenue [1]. Promoting the PFP, rather than the core offering, is one of the keys to building multiple multi-million dollar businesses [1].

Here is a quick best practice guide based on Daniel Priestley's advice regarding the Product for Prospects:

## Daniel Priestley's Guide to the Product for Prospects (PFP)

### I. PFP Definition and Commitment Level

The Product for Prospects (PFP) is designed to draw potential customers into your sales process by offering a **low commitment, easy first step** [1].

| Key Feature | Description | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To lead people to the belief that they would need your core offering [2]. It is a way of exploring what you do [1]. | [1, 2] |
| **Success Metric** | Businesses that promote the PFP are **way more successful** than those promoting their core offering [1]. Nailing the PFP is a big key for reaching seven figures [1]. | [1] |
| **Risk/Commitment** | It must feel like a **low commitment** and be an **easy first step** [1]. The PFP serves as an early-stage, easy, **low-risk way** for people to engage with the business [3]. | [1, 3] |
| **Pricing Context** | In the four-product framework (used for seven-figure businesses), the PFP is distinct from the "Gift" (which is free stuff given away) [3]. This structure suggests the PFP is focused on minimizing risk/commitment for the prospect, implying it should be low cost or nominal, but definitely not a significant commitment [1, 3]. | [1, 3] |

### II. Implementation and Promotion

The PFP should be utilized to initiate conversations and generate leads, feeding into a sales process [1].

| Implementation Step | Best Practice | Source(s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | A PFP often takes the form of an **introduction workshop** or an **assessment** [2]. | [2, 4, 5] |
| **Platform** | The PFP is typically housed on a **landing page** where people register for it [1]. The landing page is the pre-registration point [4]. | [1, 4] |
| **Promotion Strategy** | Promote the introduction (the PFP) rather than promoting your core offering [2]. Promoting the core offer is considered dangerous, expensive, and takes people out of their comfort zone [1]. | [1, 2] |
| **Tools** | You can easily set up the landing page for the PFP using a platform like scoreapp.com, which offers templates for assessments or introduction workshops [4]. | [4] |
| **Outreach** | Use direct messages (DMs) or direct email outreach (sending about 100 DMs/emails per day) to notify potential customers about the PFP, such as a newly launched assessment or introduction workshop [5, 6]. | [5, 6] |
| **Next Step** | The PFP should lead to a **one-to-one sales meeting**, which then leads to the core offering [1]. | [1] |

### III. Prospect Discovery and Feedback Questions

The goal when interacting with prospects, especially in one-to-one sales meetings following PFP engagement, is to gather **immediate feedback** and improve product-market fit, rather than just securing sales [7, 8].

Daniel Priestley outlines five key questions to ask prospects (for example, when they join a waiting list MVP), which provide enormous amounts of data for launching your business or raising investment [9].

**Five Key Discovery Questions:**

1.  **What type of person are you?** (e.g., student, executive, entrepreneur, parent) [10].
2.  **Which best describes the results you're trying to achieve?** (What are you trying to get done?) [9].
3.  **Which best describes the biggest challenge or the biggest frustration or problem that you've experienced while trying to get that result?** (Allow for multiple selections) [9].
4.  **What else have you tried?** [9].
5.  **Which price point best describes your current budget for getting this done right now?** [9].

**Key Feedback Question (For Non-Buyers):**

If a prospect is not interested in buying, view it as an opportunity for "free consulting" [8]. Do not get deflated; get excited and simply listen [8].

*   **"What is the thing that's stopping you from going ahead?"** [8].
