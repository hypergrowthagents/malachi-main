This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is designed to help you implement the principles of speed and acceleration discussed in the video "Why being FAST makes you more successful (just copy me)" [1]. The core belief is that successful people differentiate themselves through speed, not necessarily IQ, talent, or strategy, allowing them to make the same progress much faster [1].

## Standard Operating Procedure for Achieving Success Through Speed

**Objective:** To accelerate progress, compress decades into years, and achieve entrepreneurial goals significantly faster by consistently implementing seven core speed principles [1-3].

---

### Step 1: Burn the Boats (Create Irreversible Pressure) [4, 5]

The aim of this step is to eliminate psychological escape routes, creating a scenario where hitting your goal is a *must* [4, 5].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1 Force a Deadline** | Sign up for a concrete timeline, such as an Ironman race or pre-selling a product before it has been built [5]. This establishes a fixed date for completion [5]. | [5] |
| **1.2 Put Money on the Line** | Prioritize your to-do list based on tasks where financial commitment has already been made [5]. Create financial pressure by making a bet or an "I owe you" commitment to someone else if the goal is not met [5]. | [5] |
| **1.3 Make a Public Commitment** | Commit externally to your goal by telling friends, co-workers, or investors [5]. Leverage the emotional connection to avoid the pain of failing a public promise, which is often a stronger motivator than pursuing a gain [5]. | [5] |

### Step 2: Default to Action Not Preparation (Decide and Execute Quickly) [6, 7]

Focus on execution over planning, understanding that the most successful people make a decision and then focus on making it right (using the motto "JFDI," or "just do it") [6, 7].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1 Implement the "By When" Rule** | When assigning or scheduling tasks, always demand a specific date and time (e.g., "Thursday 2 p.m.") rather than accepting arbitrary deadlines [7]. | [7] |
| **2.2 Utilize the "2-Minute Rule"** | If a task requires less than two minutes to complete, execute it immediately instead of spending time documenting the steps [7]. | [7] |
| **2.3 Apply the "70% Rule" for Decisions** | When faced with incomplete data, make a decision as soon as 70% of the necessary data is gathered [8]. Recognize that entrepreneurship requires making decisions with imperfect information, and decisions can often be reversed [8]. | [8] |
| **2.4 Distinguish Decision Types** | Separate **Type One (One-Way Door)** decisions (e.g., buying a company, raising money) from **Type Two (Revolving Door)** decisions (e.g., hiring staff) [8, 9]. Slow down for Type One decisions, but move quickly on Type Two decisions [9]. | [8, 9] |

### Step 3: Model Then Modify (Leverage Existing Blueprints) [9, 10]

Accelerate learning by identifying and adopting the strategies of successful people, recognizing that "Success leaves clues" [9].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1 Identify Successful Models** | Determine who has already achieved the success you seek (e.g., finding ethical coaches making eight figures) [10, 11]. | [10, 11] |
| **3.2 Model the Blueprint** | Acquire the models or playbooks from these successful people and execute them line by line initially to test and understand them [9, 11]. If direct access is impossible, leverage AI tools (like ChatGPT) to provide indexed information and blueprints [11]. | [9, 11] |
| **3.3 Modify Strategically** | After testing, modify the model by copying the **container** (principles/essence), not just the content [10]. Integrate your unique elements—your market, product, story, or personality—to make the model your own [10]. | [10] |

### Step 4: Fire Bullets Then Cannons (Test Before Committing) [11, 12]

Employ a "shoot, shoot, shoot, calibrate" strategy to avoid crumbling under the weight of an early, massive opportunity or failing due to untested assumptions [11, 12].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4.1 List Riskiest Assumptions** | Create a list of all assumptions concerning the business model and how it will work, assuming that some aspect of the business will be wrong [13]. | [13] |
| **4.2 Prioritize and Attack** | Prioritize this list based on the riskiest assumption; if the first is wrong, the subsequent ones may be irrelevant [13]. Attack the riskiest assumption first to validate it [13]. | [13] |
| **4.3 Fire "Bullets" (Small Shots)** | Begin by building one very specific use case, pre-selling it, and gaining validation from early customers (e.g., 50 customers) [12]. This allows for quick learning before running out of time or resources [12]. | [12] |
| **4.4 Load the "Cannon"** | Only after getting "shots on goal" and calibrating your approach should you invest major resources (load the cannon) behind the validated concept [12]. | [12] |

### Step 5: Simplify Your Business (Eliminate Complexity) [14, 15]

Actively fight complexity, as complexity killers are necessary to prevent chaos from scaling and burying the team in unnecessary procedures and decisions [14].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5.1 Simplify Goals** | Identify the "leading domino"—the single thing that, if achieved, causes everything else to fall into place [14]. Focus intensely on this single priority [14]. | [14] |
| **5.2 Simplify Decisions** | Minimize unnecessary daily decisions (e.g., wearing the same colored shirt) to conserve mental energy for critical challenges [14]. | [14] |
| **5.3 Simplify Workflows** | If a task is done once and will be repeated (e.g., weekly), create automation so the task never needs to be performed manually again [15]. | [15] |
| **5.4 Simplify Commitments** | Design a fixed calendar (a "rhythm of success") for recurring personal and business commitments (e.g., date night every Thursday) to eliminate weekly decision-making [15]. | [15] |
| **5.5 Conduct Regular Pruning** | Deliberately and consistently prune complexity and processes that have evolved into "weeds" to keep the business lean and focused [15]. | [15] |

### Step 6: Get Obsessed with Your Progress (Embrace Intensity) [15, 16]

Recognize that world-class achievement requires a "season of obsession" and focus, even if this intensity is criticized by others [15, 16].

| Procedure | Actionable Task | Source Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6.1 Immersion (Drinking from the Fire Hose)** | Consume information rapidly and intensely on your focus area, as if standing under a waterfall [16]. | [16] |
| **6.2 Curate an Obsessed Network** | Surround yourself with other experts who are also obsessed with the subject matter (e.g., curating an AI expert round table) to learn faster and process complex information collectively [16]. | [16] |
| **6.3 Learn Principles, Not Tactics** | When studying successful people, focus on understanding the *principles* behind their decisions and *how* they think, rather than momentary tactics that quickly become obsolete [2]. | [2] |

### Step 7: Go Find Bigger Problems (Seek Discomfort and Growth) [2, 17]

To compress decades into years, constantly seek out new and larger challenges, accepting that "what got you here will not get you there" [2, 17].

| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| **7.1 Embrace Discomfort**       | Become comfortable with the feeling of being uncomfortable, as life is like a video game where achieving a new level requires being okay with "sucking again" temporarily [2, 17].                                                       | [2, 17]          |
| **7.2 Seek Higher Maxima**       | Always pursue bigger problems (e.g., "jet fuel problems" instead of "oil change problems") [17]. Be willing to temporarily slow down or retreat ("go down through the valley") to climb the next, larger mountain ("local maxima") [17]. | [17]             |
| **7.3 Reset and Expand  Vision** | Take your current vision and add a zero (10x your goal) [3]. Ask the fundamental question, "Why not me?" to encourage decisions that align with massive growth over the next 10-25 years [3].                                            | [3]              |
