## ICP - Primary Use Cases

I can think of these systems applying to a couple of unique use cases that may be different ICPs:

 1. For companies who already have existing spend and channels, are not starting from zero to one, but have something already operating at enough scale where there's data and we can identify what's working and figure out how to scale it up. They already have an individual or team managing paid growth and need help scaling up their team. So it's solving more of the going from 100 to 1000 problem and less about solving the zero to one problem.
 2. Solving the zero to one problem where you stand up a new channel and have to develop plans from the ground up. Or working with companies who have no internal resources to manage growth marketing and need an end-to-end solution.

And I think there is a heavy amount of overlap between these two, where you could come into an existing channel, audit what exists, and come up with a new strategy. That new strategy may be to change some things, but not all things. 

## Core Value Props

- Scale growth marketing with **lean** internal teams
	- Sub-text: one person will now be able to run a program that would have required five people in the past, which means you’ll save a lot of money using these AI systems
- Move **faster** than your competitors with growth AI
	- Sub-text: leveraging these AI systems will allow you to learn and grow faster than your competitors who are doing things the traditional way or stuck trying to figure out how to unlock Ai effectively

## Key Gaps in AI tooling

1. Hypothesis: AI agents that tech platforms and software companies are making will get really good at running specific workflows, but they lack deep growth marketing experience and best practices that will prevent them from being world class
2. Hypothesis: AI agents will lack the full context of your business and proprietary knowledge, so gaps will exist that require lots of inputs to overcome 

Other Gaps:
1. Most companies will not want to do the work themselves, even if you give them the tools. They will want a trusted expert to do it for them.
	1. Implication: If one person is capable of running these agents to manage growth marketing, we can train internal people to run these systems for clients who don’t have internal resources as a distinct market segment (initial market segment would be companies that have internal resources)

Augment Growth exists to solve these gaps by making context-aware agents that work alongside growth experts to significantly accelerate execution and outcomes. 

## AI Systems

### 1. Strategy
“The Head of Growth Marketing”

The strategy system essentially tries to answer the question, "What should we do next?" This is a non-deterministic question, and there could be many potential answers to this. This is also typically where humans add the most value in the process, but there's a lot that AI can do to make this easier. Particularly on the research analysis and insights side of things that ladder up into helping to answer the more strategic questions.

So trying to identify the inputs and data sources that help clarify what the problems are, the focus areas, the opportunities, and lay out a plan of attack. I think there are a few key things that pop up in my mind when I think about what we could build within the strategy system:

 1. Competitive channel research: Understanding the paid growth channels that competitors are using and where we want to focus energy on through competitive intelligence tools like SimilarWeb or Data.ai
 2. Channel like media plans where we actually map out the strategy for what we plan to do within a channel, whether in a zero-to-one build out or a channel audit that helps us understand what the problems and opportunities are within a channel
 3. Experimentation road map which could exist across things like a creative testing road map, a landing page optimization road map, or an audience testing approach 
 4. **Stay current on platform changes** - Monitor and summarize changes with new features, algorithm updates, policy changes, and best practices

This system would probably be 50/50 split between AI and human effort - mostly augmented but not replaced.
### 2. Creative Production
“The Creative Producer”

The creative system would be all about generating assets to help fuel marketing channels ranging from static to video to copy and even landing page copy and wireframes. Essentially, the system manages the communication touchpoints with the customer and needs to be deeply embedded in an understanding of who the customer is and what they want and react to. 

Some key workflows within the system would be: 

1. Competitive ad analysis and deconstruction. This would analyze the types of assets and the specific messages and visual components within those assets to help us understand as a baseline what competitors are doing that we think is working and that we would like to emulate.
 2. Taking a winning ad from our own campaigns and coming up with a variety of variants and iterations that are significant enough to push it into new audiences or pain points or any direction that leverages elements of what we think is working about that creative but potentially extends it further, and also can convert it into different formats (e.g., take a static and move it into video concepts or take a video concept and make a carousel). 
 3. Testing roadmap to static image matrix. This would take the analysis of what the learning objectives are from one of the strategic agents where a creative testing roadmap was developed, and flesh that into a large number of static ads that can test elements of that creative roadmap and quickly identify things that have the highest potential. And would be cheap enough to generate and run to get quick signal on what people react to, especially across hooks and value props. 
 4. Similar to testing roadmap to static, we could develop a product URL to static workflow where you can plug in the URL and it comes up with a variety of different concept ideas for statics. This could also be replicated for videos. 
 5. **Develop creative briefs** - Provide guidance to designers/creators on what to produce next. Concept idea and testing roadmap to creative brief. This would take a high-level idea and a little bit of information about what we think works or doesn't work from analysis and would convert it into a very detailed creative brief. A creative brief could be for a static image, laying out the copy and design direction. Or it could be for a secondary one could be for the video script with shot-by-shot outlines, a script would be the starting point. And it would generate keyframes for the video, as well as the dialogue, which could then be brought into an image/video generation model and built out from there. 
 6. Add creative prediction engine, which can take concept ideas and strip out ones that seem unlikely to work with our ICP and come up with new ideas that replace them. 
 7. Keyword to search: Copy generation, specifically focused on creating personalized ad copy variants to feed Google RSAs that would line up with the types of keyword clusters they're going to be used for. 
 8. Creative feedback agent - Creative direction to review assets, provide feedback, request revisions
 9. Brand enforcement agent. This agent would look at the outputs and ensure that they are following the specific brand guidelines and nuances that have been laid out in place. The output is sort of a QA check and a way to polish them a little bit more to make them more on brand. 
 10. Ad channel creatives best practices agent. Potentially one for each channel that's specifically dialed into the creative and copy best practices for each of the channels. Can take an initial creative brief and flesh it out into more dialed-in conversion-optimized create a free channel. 
 11. Clip assembly agent. Able to edit several shorter clips together, evaluate the output and adjust further. And add an end card. 
 12. Clip disassembly agent. Can take a longer video and cut it into modular clips with tags for each section of the video (e.g. hook, body, CTA).

The goal of almost any of these agents is the same: to have a larger quantity of creatives to test that are on brand, conversion optimized, and aligned to a specific channel. This helps unlock the unique features of that channel so that a company can increase their conversion rates and help scale ads into new audiences and higher spend levels. There's probably many ways to go about A-Z, starting from ending point across those, and we would just need to make this modular in a way where you can swap out some of the starting points and keep the rest of the workflows intact. 

This system would take on the persona of a creative director, designer, or copywriter. This is not a deterministic system either. Creativity is highly important in this system. Being able to think of a lot of diverse approaches to things will end up being a feature. 
### 3. Data Analysis
“The Data Analyst”

This system will take on the persona of a data analyst or performance marketing analyst - someone who is expert at going super deep into the data to find nuanced insights and patterns. 

The whole point of this system is to surface the important data and inputs that help us determine the facts on the ground so that we can determine next what we want to do about that in terms of action. 

This system in general leans towards being more deterministic, having a very grounded sense of understanding of what the facts and truths are, and reducing hallucinations. It aligns to specific KPIs and is able to have a longer-term memory of what has happened in the past, what the learnings are, what actions were taken, and what actually occurred, so we can determine whether things are successful or failures, whether things are trending positively or negatively. 

A few of the key workflows for this would be:

 1. A KPI dashboard that captures the trends across the main KPIs for the Paid Growth Program. At a glance, it gives a quick understanding of whether or not everything is going well, or if action needs to be taken. It's designed for more of an executive-level view. 
 2. A channel comparison analysis which answers the question of how we're pacing against spend targets and how return on ad spend is trending, and whether any changes need to be managed in terms of reallocating budgets in order to hit a desired revenue or profitability level for the company across the channels. 
 3. Monitor campaign performance - Check dashboards for spend pacing, performance anomalies, and budget delivery
	 1. A campaign analysis agent that looks across campaigns and the main KPIs comparing one period to another, identifying significant changes or anomalies, and then going one or more levels deeper to understand what is driving that change, whether it's positive or negative. If there are issues with event tracking, or if there were dramatic differences in the types of ads that scaled up or down that are impacting performance negatively. And answer the why so that a performance marketer knows where to spend their time and energy that day. Potentially, this runs a couple of times a week for the average company, and it could be dialed up to 5-7 days a week if it was a really high velocity program. 
 4. An attribution agent that looks at attribution across different data sources, compares variances, and looks for major anomalies or issues. It captures those in order to increase an understanding of what attribution potentially is telling us. 
 5. Conduct cohort analysis - Track user behavior and retention by acquisition source/date
 6. An ad creative testing agent that can look at a creative report and determine winners from losers and determine whether they've reached any sort of statistical significance. It's essentially a creative testing analyst. This agent is not focused on the internal assets themselves but rather on the outcomes of testing and performance data, which can inform future creative concepts. 
 7. A weekly performance report agent that does the grunt work of pulling together a total overview of how a performance program is doing, saving the performance marketer hours of time each week. And puts it into a nice, pretty format that is ready to go with their brand colors for any exec team review. 
 8. Similar to the creative testing agent, we could have an experimentation learnings agent that captures any type of new test or experiment that was run and focuses on extracting the data points and the learnings, storing it in a library for future analysis or leverage. 
 9. The conversion funnel analyst - identifies where we are losing people at each step of the user journey across segments.
 10. **Forecast and budget planning** - Model out spend scenarios, project results, allocate budgets across channels

5. Search keyword planning agent 

## Guiding Principles

The use of AI systems should follow some guiding principles to ensure we are leveraging AI and humans for the most beneficial tasks.

1. Everything is text. Every doc, image, video, and voice file can be converted into a text file for easy ingestion by an LLM (without coding or specialized models required to use). For example, a video transcript or meeting notes.
2. Humans should own or oversee any task that either A) is high risk/importance, or B) requires judgement or taste.
3. We should break down agentic workflows into smaller “building block” modules. Not only will this make them less brittle and likely to fail, but it will also allow us to leverage them in multiple workflows without having to rebuild parts each time. We want legos not castles.
4. AI process documentation is the glue that holds the system together. Workflows will be done manually several times and turned into SOPs before automation. This gives us a chance to flesh out our workflow steps and think through edge cases, so the workflow can be properly designed to handle those. The better we can document our knowledge, the better the context is for AI systems to use.
