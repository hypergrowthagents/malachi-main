### Engagement Overview

- Rick Fox expressing strong support for 3-day approach proposal
- Company went through public offering, bankruptcy, restructuring
- New leadership team bringing fresh perspective to fragmented organization
- Need to figure out why business owners push back against changes (per Malachirose’s analysis)

### Organizational Challenges

- Legacy mindset from previous struggles creating defensive postures
- Multiple business units operating in silos with “mine” mentality
- Previous attempts at centralization failed due to:
  - Leadership talking without getting hands dirty
  - Lack of operational expertise
  - Business unit pushback from fear of losing control
- Current approach requires “velvet glove” with “iron fist” backup when necessary

### Team Structure

- PNC (Property & Casualty Insurance): 90%+ auto insurance, largest business unit
  - KMAC leads media buying plus multiple other responsibilities
  - Laura (recently returned to company) and one other team member
  - Very closed off and siloed operation
- Health Insurance: Over 65 and under 65 segments
  - Scott leads media team, also handles Education vertical
  - Ron/Rob on team (Rick hasn’t met yet)
- Education: Small vertical under health team, uncertain future investment
- Home Services: Planned expansion for 2026 but doesn’t exist yet

### Data Situation

- Current state: 47 different “sources of truth” making analysis impossible
- Messy data preventing ability to identify what’s making money and how to improve profit
- Board members with data experience providing helpful support
- Target timeline:
  - Serviceable single source of truth by end of 2024
  - Full data infrastructure ready by Q1 2025
- Manual workarounds available with analyst support for critical decisions

### Strategic Approach Discussion

- Malachirose suggesting relationship-first approach rather than immediate control grab
- Dotted line reporting initially while building trust and alignment
- Data-driven decision making to avoid opinion battles
- Focus on showing results quickly to build credibility
- Reference to similar successful transformation at Zynga with autonomous studios

### AI and Automation Vision

- Foundation work must come first before automation
- Three-phase approach:
  - Stabilize foundations (data, strategy, alignment)
  - Implement best practices (experimentation, creative production)
  - Scale with AI augmentation
- Claude Code as primary tool for agentic systems
- Goal to make team AI-first in workflows rather than full automation
- Training team to “think differently and act bigger” beyond just task completion

### Next Steps

- Rick will discuss with Jen and have her reach out to Malachirose
- Timeline preference for quick start (1-3 weeks vs 1-3 months)
- Rick fully supportive of moving forward with engagement
