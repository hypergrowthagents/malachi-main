### Current situation

- Malachi presented Augment Growth business model update to Sawyer for feedback
  - Combining growth marketing and AI tools into one cohesive offering
  - Core approach involves leveraging AI as an augmented tool for growth marketing workflows (analytics, creative strategy, optimization)
  - Has two pilot companies interested in co-developing AI solutions
  - Main question: where is the market need - AI implementation, education/training, or execution/agency model?
- Starting with fractional CMO approach to get real-world feedback
  - One company wants fractional CMO/VP of Growth role while bringing team up to speed on AI
  - Gaming studio example: has one performance marketer and fractional creative person, needs to crack profitable user acquisition

### Their insights

#### Business model and positioning validation

- Fractional route makes sense as entry point since people don’t know what to hire an “AI guru” for
- Companies do know how to buy growth strategy guidance and leadership
- Malachi’s advantage: deep growth marketing expertise combined with AI implementation knowledge
- This combination is rare - most AI workflows on LinkedIn are “kind of bullshit” and don’t drive real value

#### Customer segmentation and prioritization

- Two distinct customer segments requiring different approaches:
  - Early-stage companies (pre-Series A)
    - Need execution and throughput more than optimization
    - Want agency-style “doing it for them” approach
    - Focus on middle box of Malachi’s framework (creative strategy and production)
    - Less need for sophisticated analytics initially
  - Series A/B companies with existing growth marketers
    - Performance marketer already on team but overwhelmed
    - Need AI coworkers to multiply single person into “five people internally”
    - Higher priority for advanced workflows and optimization
- Critical consideration: ensure customers have enough volume/scale to justify sophisticated AI workflows
  - Many workflows don’t move the needle for low-volume businesses
  - Business model must be viable - charge enough to make complex implementations worthwhile

#### Technical approach and platform choice

- Claude Code as primary platform choice is smart
  - Most marketers aren’t using it despite superior capabilities
  - Can build custom marketing systems tailored to specific businesses
  - All work saved as artifacts in GitHub repos for reusability
- Concerns about data reliability in AI-driven analytics:
  - Probabilistic models calculating CAC differently each time creates problems
  - Need deterministic logic for most data operations
  - Qualitative/creative work more suitable for probabilistic AI
- Go Marble example (Indian startup with free Meta MCP):
  - Represents commodity-level AI platform connections
  - Likely not sustainable as standalone business
  - Building creative modules and agency layer on top
- Recommendation: carve off specific, non-brittle, repeatable workflows rather than trying to automate everything

#### Market positioning against competitors

- Go Marble targeting lower-end market (bootstrapped/seed companies)
- Opportunity for Malachi to position as premium offering
- “Many years off” from full automation of growth marketing for real businesses
- Actual experts won’t be displaced anytime soon
- Focus on high-value workflows that fold in 20+ years of growth marketing expertise

#### Partnership and collaboration opportunities

- Roadway building foundation data infrastructure with deterministic, reliable data
- Potential integration: Roadway handling data layer, Malachi building growth workflows on top
- Roadway adding MCP connections and giving their “coworker guy” more tools
- Areas Roadway won’t focus on: detailed platform optimization, creative workflows
- Complementary rather than competitive positioning

### Next steps

#### Immediate actions for Malachi

- Map out detailed workflow prioritization and specifications
  - Focus on highest-priority, specific use cases rather than broad capabilities
  - Ensure workflows are non-brittle and repeatable
  - Start with foundational workflows everyone needs vs. sophisticated advanced ones
- Send Sawyer outline of prioritized growth marketing workflows for feedback
- Schedule follow-up meeting to discuss workflow details and potential collaboration areas

#### Collaboration exploration

- Sawyer to review Go Marble’s full platform and MCP implementation
- Identify specific areas where Malachi could help Roadway:
  - Dialing in agents and use cases
  - Growth marketing workflows that complement Roadway’s data foundation
  - Areas Roadway won’t prioritize but customers need
- Explore technical integration possibilities:
  - Connecting Claude Code to Roadway’s data infrastructure
  - Leveraging Roadway’s deterministic data layer for Malachi’s AI workflows

#### Strategic considerations

- Keep scope narrow initially - focus on specific high-value workflows rather than trying to solve everything
- Validate that pilot companies have sufficient volume/scale to benefit from sophisticated AI workflows
- Consider hybrid approach: deterministic data foundation with AI augmentation for strategy and creative work
